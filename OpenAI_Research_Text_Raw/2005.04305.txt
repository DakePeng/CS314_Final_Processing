Measuring the Algorithmic Efﬁciency of Neural NetworksDanny Hernandez⇤OpenAIdanny@openai.comTom B. BrownOpenAItom@openai.comAbstractThree factors drive the advance of AI: algorithmic innovation, data, and the amount ofcompute available for training. Algorithmic progress has traditionally been more difﬁcultto quantify than compute and data. In this work, we argue that algorithmic progress hasan aspect that is both straightforward to measure and interesting: reductions over timein the compute needed to reach past capabilities. We show that the number of ﬂoating-point operations required to train a classiﬁer to AlexNet-level performance on ImageNethas decreased by a factor of 44x between 2012 and 2019. This corresponds to algorithmicefﬁciency doubling every 16 months over a period of 7 years. Notably, this outpaces theoriginal Moore’s law rate of improvement in hardware efﬁciency (11x over this period).We observe that hardware and algorithmic efﬁciency gains multiply and can be on a similarscale over meaningful horizons, which suggests that a good model of AI progress shouldintegrate measures from both.

For this reason, we believe measuring overall progress in AI/ML is acrucial question, because it can ground the discussion in evidence. Measuring AI progress is critical to poli-cymakers, economists, industry leaders, potential researchers, and others trying to navigate this disagreementand decide how much money and attention to invest in AI.For example, the compute used by the largest AI training runs per year grew at 300,000x between 2012 and2018 [Amodei & Hernandez, 2018]. Given the divergence from the past trend of approximately Moore’sLaw level growth for such training runs, [Sastry et al., 2019] suggests policymakers increase funding forcompute resources for academia, so they can continue to do the types of AI research that are becoming moreexpensive. Measurements of AI progress inform policymakers that are making such decisions.Hardware trends are relatively quantiﬁable. Moore’s Law explains much of the advance from mainframes, topersonal computers, to omnipresent smartphones [Moore, 1965]. Better measurement of scientiﬁc progresshas the potential for a lot of impact on a variety of fronts. Given the existing understanding of key hardwaretrends, we were primarily interested in measures that represented exclusively algorithmic improvement thatcould help paint a picture of the overall progress of the ﬁeld.We present measurements of algorithmic efﬁciency state of the arts over time that:1.Are informative to a wide audience of decision makers2.Help measure novel contributions produced with smaller amounts of compute1.2 Efﬁciency is the primary way we measure algorithmic progress on classic computer scienceproblems. We can apply the same lens to machine learning by holding performance constantIn a classic computer science problem like sorting, algorithmic quality is primarily measured in terms of howcost asymptotically increases with problem difﬁculty, generally denoted in Big O Notation. For example,quicksort [Hoare, 1962] hasO(nlogn)average cost in terms of operations to ﬁnd a perfect solution whereasmany sorting algorithms areO(n2)(wherenis the length of the list to be sorted). It’s impractical to performsimilar analysis for deep learning, because we’re looking for approximate solutions and don’t have as clear ameasure of problem difﬁculty. For these reasons, in machine learning, algorithmic progress is often presentedin terms of new states of the art, like a 1% absolute increase in top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, ignoring cost.It’s difﬁcult to reason about overall progress in terms of a large collection of such measures, because:1.Performance is often measured in different units (accuracy, BLEU, points, ELO, cross-entropy loss,etc) and gains on many of the metrics are hard to interpret. For instance going from 94.99% accuracyto 99.99% accuracy is much more impressive than going from 89% to 94%.2.The problems are unique and their difﬁculties aren’t comparable quantitively, so assessment requiresgaining an intuition for each problem.3.Most research focuses on reporting overall performance improvements rather than efﬁciency im-provements, so additional work is required to disentangle the gains due to algorithmic efﬁciencyfrom the gains due to additional computation.4.The benchmarks of interest are being solved more rapidly, which exacerbates 1) and 2). For instanceit took 15 years to get to human-level performance on MNIST [LeCun et al., 1998], 7 years onImageNet [Deng et al., 2009, Russakovsky et al., 2015], and GLUE [Wang et al., 2018] only lasted9 months [Devlin et al., 2018, Liu et al., 2019].We show that we can gain clear insights into efﬁciency trends by analyzing training costs while holdingperformance constant. We focused on training efﬁciency rather than inference efﬁciency, because we’re moreinterested in what systems are possible to produce than how much it costs to run those systems. Though wenote increased inference efﬁciency can have important economic implications [van den Oord et al., 2017]. Inthe research setting, we’ve typically found ourselves FLOPS bound rather than memory or communication3bound. So we measured total ﬂoating-point operations used in training rather than parameters or anothermeasure of efﬁciency.We focused on AlexNet-level performance, which we measured as 79.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet.AlexNet kicked off the wave of interest in neural networks and ImageNet is still a benchmark of wide in-terest, so this measure provided a long running trend to analyze.2 Related Work2.1 Algorithmic progress had similar rate to Moore’s Law in some domains over decadesGrace compared algorithmic progress to hardware progress looked at over several decades in the domains ofchess, go, physics simulations, mixed integer programming, and SAT solvers [Grace, 2013]. Grace’s overallconclusion wasMany of these areas appear to experience fast improvement, though the data are oftennoisy. For tasks in these areas, gains from algorithmic progress have been roughly ﬁfty toone hundred percent as large as those from hardware progress. Improvements tend to beincremental, forming a relatively smooth curve on the scale of yearsFor the most part, these estimates and their interpretation require substantial amounts of judgment. Forinstance, with chess and Go the approach was to use the available literature to estimate what kinds of returnscame from a hardware doubling and then attribute all ELO improvement not explained by Moore’s law tosoftware. Additionally, Grace suggests we treat these estimates as "optimistic" rather than representative,because of increased saliency of problems that are making fast progress, problems with good measures beinglikely to progress faster, and the potential motivations of authors. Regardless, we think this related workshows that hardware and algorithmic progress can be on a similar scale, and that even a relatively simplemodel of progress should consider integrating measures from both domains.Progress on mixed integer programming was particularly straightforward to measure, so we’ve extended theoriginal analysis of that domain below [Bixby, 2012].2.2 Linear programming gains were well-deﬁned, steady, and faster than Moore’s Law for 21 yearsUnlike some other optimization domains Grace looked at, linear programming was of commercial interestfor a long period. Progress is easy to track in this domain over this 21 year period because there were distinctreleases of commercial software (CPLEX and Gurobi) that can be compared with hardware held ﬁxed.The trend of a 2x speedup every 13 months observed in Figure 1 is surprisingly consistent over a long timehorizon. The smooth progress is partially explained by the measure being an aggregation of many problemsof varying difﬁculty. Over this time Moore’s Law yielded an efﬁciency gain of approximately 1500x.Caveats1.It’s notable that the benchmark was designed and the analysis was performed by the CEO of Gurobi(a commercial MIPS solver) and that he had an incentive to demonstrate large amounts of progress.2.It’s worth pointing out the implications of the maximum search time of 30,000s for the optimalsolution. When it took longer than 30,000s for the solver to ﬁnd the optimal solution, 30,000sis what would be recorded. It’s expected that the maximum search time would have been invokedmore for earlier, weaker solvers. Thus, the maximum search time made earlier solvers look relativelystronger, making the overall estimate conservative for this benchmark. We think using a maximumsearch time is reasonable, but we expect the overall speedup is sensitive to it. In this sense, thesemeasurements are a little different than the AlexNet accuracy measurements, where we waited forthe capability to be demonstrated before measuring progress.3.This is the related domain with highest amount of measured algorithmic efﬁciency progress we’reaware of for this period of time.4Cumulative speedup1101001000100001000001000000
1995200020052010500,000x Speedup in Mixed Integer Programming over 20 YearsFigure 1A 2x speedup every 13 months was observed on a benchmark of 1,892 mixed-integer problems(MIPs), a subset of linear programming. This benchmark was created by Bixby, he describes it as a set of"real-world problems that had been collected from academic and industry sources over 21 years." Progress isbased on the total time spent searching for the optimal solution for all problems in the benchmark. Progressis easy to track in this domain over this 21 year period because there were distinct releases of commercialsoftware (CPLEX and Gurobi) that can be compared with hardware held ﬁxed. A maximum search time of30,000 seconds (approximately 8 hours) per problem was used, so that’s what was recorded for instanceswhere the optimum wasn’t found. We clariﬁed the trend by graphing the trend by release date rather than byversion number [Bixby, 2012].2.3 184x reduction in training cost (in dollars) to get to ResNet-50 performance since 2017The eventual unit institutions generally care about for training cost is dollars. Earlier we observed a 10xefﬁciency improvement in terms of training FLOPs required to get ResNet-50 level accuracy (92.9% top-5accuracy target on ImageNet). On the same target, DawnBench submissions have surpassed the contest’soriginal benchmark cost, $2323, by a factor of 184x [Coleman et al., 2017]. This brought the cost of such atraining down to $12.60 in September 2017, less than a year after the competition was announced. Trainingcost in dollars is a useful overall measure, that aggregates:1.The efﬁciency gains from algorithmic progress we are most interested in within this paper.2.Moore’s Law’s effect on GPUs, TPUs, etc.3.Reduced cloud computing costs driven by modernization and increased competition.4.Hardware utilization. It’s not trivial to efﬁciently use the FLOPS capacity of GPUs, TPUs, etc.The DawnBench results make it clear that 3. and 4. can also be notable contributions to training efﬁciencythat are worth measuring. More targeted measurements, like training efﬁciency in terms of FLOPs, helpclarify the takeaway from measures like DawnBench that aggregate multiple effects.2.4 We can estimate costly-to-observe algorithmic efﬁciency improvements through scaling lawsWe’ve focused on algorithmic efﬁciency improvements that are observable empirically. [Kaplan McCandlish2020] showed that language model performance on cross-entropy had power-law scaling with the amount ofcompute over several orders of magnitude. Empirical scaling laws can be extrapolated to provide an estimateof how much we would have needed to scale up older models to reach current levels of performance. Through5this mechanism scaling laws provide insight on efﬁciency gains that may require prohibitively expensiveamounts of compute to observe directly.2.5 Total investment in AI through private startups, public offerings, and mergers/acquisitions wentup 5x between 2012 and 2018We’ve primarily considered algorithmic, hardware, and data as the inputs in progress in machine learning.Money spent would be another reasonable lens since that’s the lever available to decision-makers at thehighest level. [Bloom et al., 2017] looks into the relationship between scientiﬁc progress and spending:In many models, economic growth arises from people creating ideas, and the long-rungrowth rate is the product of two terms: the effective number of researchers and their re-search productivity... A good example is Moore’s Law. The number of researchers requiredtoday to achieve the famous doubling every two years of the density of computer chips ismore than 18 times larger than the number required in the early 1970s. Across a broadrange of case studies at various levels of (dis)aggregation, we ﬁnd that ideas – and theexponential growth they imply – are getting harder to ﬁnd. Exponential growth results fromlarge increases in research effort that offset its declining productivity.AI investment is also up substantially since 2012, and it seems likely this was important to maintainingalgorithmic progress at the observed level. [Raymond Perrault & Niebles, 2019] notes that:1.Private investment in AI startups rose from $7B in 2012 to $40B in 2018.2.Investment through public offerings and mergers/acquisitions grew from $5B in 2012 to $23B in2018.3.The DOD is projected to invest $4.0B on AI R&D in ﬁscal year 2020.4.Contract spending on AI by the US government has grown from about $150M to $728M between2012 and 2018.3 Methods3.1 Main result primarily based on existing open source re-implementations of popular modelsFor the majority of the architectures shown in Figure 3 [Szegedy et al., 2014, Simonyan & Zisserman,2014, He et al., 2015, Xie et al., 2016, Huang et al., 2016, Iandola et al., 2016, Zagoruyko & Komodakis,2016, Zhang et al., 2017, Howard et al., 2017, Sandler et al., 2018, Ma et al., 2018, Tan & Le, 2019] we usedPyTorch’s example models [Paszke et al., 2017] with Pytorch’s suggested hyperparameters. We mark ourdeviation from their hyperparameters in the next section. We supplemented PyTorch’s example models withexisting implementations of MobileNet, ShufﬂeNet [Xiao, 2017,Huang, 2017].Compute used is based on the product of the following:1.FLOPs per training image, which was counted by a PyTorch library [Zhu, 2019] that we checkedagainst other methods for several models2.The number of images per epoch3.The number of epochs it took an architecture to perform better than or equal to the AlexNet modelwe trained3.2 We made few hyperparameter adjustments between architectures and did minimal tuningWe largely followed the suggested hyperparameters from the PyTorch example models. For all points shownin ﬁgure 3 we trained using SGD with a batch size of 256, momentum of 0.9, and weight decay of 1e-4, for90 epochs. For pre-batch norm architectures, we began with the suggested learning rate of 0.01 (GoogleNetand VGG), for all other architectures we began with the suggested learning rate of 0.1.For AlexNet we followed the original paper’s learning rate schedule of decaying by a factor of 10 every30 epochs. For all other models, we followed the suggested 1000x total learning rate reduction. To sanitycheck that these were reasonable hyperparameters, we performed a scan on ResNet18 where we set the6initial learning rate to 0.0316, 0.1, and 0.316 and total decay to 250x, 1000x, and 2500x. The suggestedhyperparameters performed the best. For all models other than AlexNet we smoothed out the learning rateschedule, which was important for early learning as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2Smoothing out the learning rate improved early learning, which is the regime we were interestedin. ResNet-50 learning curves pictured.A natural concern would be that new models aren’t optimized well for compute in reaching AlexNet-levelperformance. Before smoothing the learning rate schedule, many models hit AlexNet performance at exactly31 epochs, when the learning rate was reduced by a factor of 10x. This adjustment often increased ourmeasured efﬁciency by 2-4x, but we didn’t observe meaningful differences in ﬁnal performance from thechange in learning rate schedule. So even though the change to the learning rate schedule could be consideredminimal, it has a large effect on our measurements. The more simple shape of the updated learning curve,suggests that optimizing for convergence might be relatively compatible with optimizing for lower levels ofperformance, like AlexNet-level accuracy.As context for the quality of these re-implementations we provide tables in Appendix C that compare theﬁnal accuracy we reached to the original paper results.4 Results4.1 Key Result: 44x less compute needed to get to AlexNet-level performanceIn ﬁgure 3 we show that between 2012 and 2019 the amount of compute that neural net architectures requireto be trained from scratch to AlexNet level performance has gone down by a factor of 44x (16-month doublingtime)Most researchers found the algorithmic efﬁciency gains to surprisingly high and regular. The progress isfaster than the original Moore’s Law rate (11x) over this period, where both trends made training models ofAlexNet-level performance cheaper. Moore’s Law is obviously a more general trend than what we observein Figure 3. We believe it’s quite interesting to see what we can say about algorithmic efﬁciency progress ingeneral given these types of measurement, and we explore this question in sections 4.2 and 5.4.
7Figure 3Lowest compute points at any given time shown in blue, all points measured shown in gray. Weobserved an efﬁciency doubling time of 16 months.We can split the progress in training efﬁciency into data efﬁciency (needing fewer epochs) and reductionsin the number of FLOPs required per epoch. Table 1 below shows this split for the models that were theefﬁciency state of the art for a time.We can see that both reductions in training epochs and FLOPs per training image play an important andvarying factor in the overall algorithmic efﬁciency gains. This type of analysis is somewhat sensitive to howfar the original work pushed towards convergence.2Other limitations are discussed in sections 5.4 and 5.7.Calculations for the ﬁgure 3 are provided in Appendix B. Relevant information for EfﬁcientNet training costwas provided through correspondence with authors.
2It only took 62 of the 90 epochs for AlexNet to train to 78.8% top 5 accuracy on ImageNet (99.6% of the 79.1%ﬁnal accuracy). So if the original AlexNet had only been trained for 62 epochs, we would have calculated the overallalgorithmic efﬁciency gain as 30x rather than 44x. We don’t think it’s tractable to mitigate this confounder without addinga lot of complexity to explaining the measurement, but it seemed important to ﬂag as a limitation of our approach.8Table 1Breakdown of total training efﬁciency gains in reaching AlexNet-level accuracy into reduction oftraining epochs and ﬂops per epochExperimentTraining epochs factorFLOPs per epoch factorTraining efﬁciency factorAlexNet1.01.01.0GoogleNet110.384.3MobileNet_v18.21.3511ShufﬂeNet_v1_1x3.85.521ShufﬂeNet_v2_1x4.55.525EfﬁcientNet-b0222.0444.2 FLOPs based learning curves can help clarify comparisons between modelsWe ﬁnd it noteworthy that in when we plot FLOPs based learning curves in ﬁgure 4 some architecturesdominate others.

ResNet-50 dominates VGG-11 and GoogLeNet dominates AlexNet on this plot. That is for all amounts of trainingcompute they get better accuracy. VGG-11 reached higher ﬁnal accuracy than AlexNet, but it took morecompute to get to all levels of performance than AlexNet.4.3 We observed a similar rate of progress for ResNet-50 level classiﬁcation performance and fasterrates of efﬁciency improvement in Go, Dota, and Machine TranslationWe’re also interested in measuring progress on frontier AI capabilities, the capabilities that are currentlyattracting the most attention and investment. It seems to us as if language modeling [Devlin et al., 2018,Radford et al., , Raffel et al., 2019] and playing games [Silver et al., 2016, Silver et al., 2017, Silver et al.,2018, OpenAI et al., 2019] are the domains of interest given our criteria.Within those domains, our desiderata were:1.task of sufﬁcient difﬁculty to demonstrate that improvements work at scale [Sutton, 2019]92.benchmark of high interest over long horizon in which there’s general agreement we’ve observedlarge progress in capabilities.3.sufﬁciently good publicly available information/re-implementations to easily make an estimateIt’s hard to get all these desiderata, but Table 2 below summarizes all the data we have observed.Table 2Increased efﬁciency (in terms of FLOPs) in reaching the same performance on select tasks.OriginalImprovedTaskEfﬁciency FactorPeriodDoubling TimeAlexNetEfﬁcientNetImageNet44x6 years16 monthsResNetEfﬁcientNetImageNet10x4 years17 monthsSeq2SeqTransformerWMT-1461x3 years6 monthsGNMTTransformerWMT-149x1 year4 monthsAlphaGo ZeroAlphaZeroGO8x*1 year*4 months*OpenAI FiveOpenAI RerunDota5x*2 months*25 days**The work on Go and Dota are over shorter time scales and more the result of one research group ratherthan a large scientiﬁc community, so those rates of improvement should be considered to apply to a differentregime than the rates in image recognition and translation.When we apply this lens to translation [Sutskever et al., 2014, Vaswani et al., 2017] it shows more progressthan vision over a shorter time horizon. Though we only have short horizon progress for Go and Dota, we’donly need to see a modest 3x and 5x efﬁciency gain over 5 years for their rates to surpass the rate of progresson the vision task. The underlying calculations are provided in appendix A.One might worry that the rate of progress in image recognition is very sensitive to performance level chosen,so we also did a shallow investigation of efﬁciency gains at ResNet-50 level of performance. The relevantinformation, that EfﬁcientNet-b0 took 4 epochs to get to AlexNet level accuracy, and EfﬁcientNet-b1 [Tan& Le, 2019] took 71 epochs to get to ResNet-50 level accuracy was provided through correspondence withauthors (where each was trained with 1 epoch of warmup rather than 5).We observed a similar rate of progress for efﬁciency gains in inference on ImageNet.We also did ashallow investigation into how the rate of progress on inference efﬁciency has compared to training efﬁciency.We observed that:1.Shufﬂenet [Zhang et al., 2017] achieved AlexNet-level performance with an 18x inference efﬁciencyincrease in 5 years (15-month doubling time).2.EfﬁcientNet-b0 [Tan & Le, 2019] achieved ResNet-50-level performance with a 10x inference efﬁ-ciency increase in 3 and a half years (13-month doubling time).These results suggest that training efﬁciency and inference efﬁciency might improve at somewhat similarrates. Though it’s important to note we have many fewer points across time and domains for inference.5 Discussion5.1 We attribute the 44x efﬁciency gains to sparsity, batch normalization, residual connections,architecture search, and appropriate scalingA more thorough study would have carefully ablated all the features of interest from successful models whilecontrolling for model size to be able to attribute the efﬁciency gains to speciﬁc improvements in a quantitativemanner [Lipton & Steinhardt, 2018]. We performed some ablations, but primarily rely on less direct evidencewhen forming opinions about which improvements we suspect were most important to the 44x increase inefﬁciency. For instance we discuss what the original authors credit, though it’s important to recognize authorsare incentivized to emphasize novelty. We think it’s important to note that efﬁciency gains may compose in ahard to predict, non-linear manner.10Batch Normalization:Batch normalization enabled a 14x reduction in the number of ﬂoating-point oper-ations needed to train to Inception level accuracy [Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015]. It’s unclear how such algorithmicefﬁciency gains like batch normalization compose, but it seems reasonable to attribute some meaningfulportion of the gains to normalization. We made a few attempts to try and train a ShufﬂeNet without batchnormalization, but we were unable to get a model to learn. We suspect we would have needed to carefullyinitialize the network to do so [Zhang et al., 2019].Residual Connections:ShufﬂeNet units, the building blocks of ShufﬂeNet, are residual blocks. Efﬁcient-Net also has residual connections.Sparsity:GoogLeNet was explicit in describing sparsity as the primary inspiration for its architecture, andGoogLeNet alone was a 4.3x efﬁciency improvement over AlexNet. [Szegedy et al., 2014].This raises the question of whether there is any hope for a next, intermediate step: anarchitecture that makes use of the extra sparsity, even at ﬁlter level, as suggested by thetheory, but exploits our current hardware by utilizing computations on dense matrices.ShufﬂeNet largely credits replacing dense 1 x 1 convolutions with a sparser structure. If we assume all theShufﬂeNet gains came from sparsity, batch normalization, and residual connections, it seems reasonable tocredit sparsity with being able to produce at least the 4.3x that came with GoogLeNet (leaving 5.8x of the25x gain shown in Table 1 for the other two conceptual improvements).Appropriate Scaling:Given it’s architecture AlexNet was optimally sized for AlexNet-level performance.Given our tests of scaled up and scaled down models ShufﬂeNet_v2_1x, and EfﬁcientNet-b0 seem to beclose to appropriately sized for AlexNet-level performance. We tested the effect of scaling by scaling downa ResNet-50 by EfﬁcientNet’s compound scaling factor twice (1.4x less depth, 1.2 less width, 1.3 lowerresolution) [Tan & Le, 2019]. Scaling the ResNet architecture to a more appropriate size for AlexNet-levelperformance yielded a 2.1x improvement in algorithmic efﬁciency for AlexNet-level performance. Figure 8in the EfﬁcientNet paper shows that their compound scaling techniques (systematically scaling width, depth,and resolution) can result in 5x or more gains in algorithmic efﬁciency over more naive scaling approaches.Architecture Search:EfﬁcientNet seems to attribute much of its improved performance to leveraging ar-chitecture search rather than iterating on hand designed architectures. EfﬁcientNet was a 1.8x increase inalgorithmic efﬁciency over ShufﬂeNet at AlexNet-level performance.5.2 It’s unclear the degree to which the observed efﬁciency trends generalize to other AI tasksWe’re most interested in what our small number of data points suggest about algorithmic progress overallduring this period. We recognize it’s difﬁcult to go from one or more speciﬁc measures to stating anythingabout overall progress. In this section we share our current impressions and suggest measures that couldclarify the degree to which the trends we’ve observed generalize.All our measures were for tasks that have:1.received large amounts of investment (researchefr time and/or compute)2.in which there’s general agreement we’ve observed large progress in capabilities.We suspect that this style of measurement on tasks that meet these criteria is likely to show similar ratesof improvement in algorithmic efﬁciency as we’ve observed here. One concern we had, was that the ratesof improvement would be very dependent on the level of performance. That may still be the case, but wewere surprised how close the efﬁciency doubling time was for AlexNet-level performance (16 months) andResNet50-level performance (17 months). We also suspect, but are less conﬁdent, that such measurementswould should similar progress in these domains (image recognition, natural language processing, and games).We’d be very interested in such measurements.However, we’re also interested in progress in high potential tasks that don’t ﬁt these criteria, like certainreasoning tasks. In the previous section, we attributed the efﬁciency gains over AlexNet primarily to sparsity,residual connections, normalization, principled scaling, and architecture search all of which are relativelytask-agnostic. But, it’s possible that we’d observe only small efﬁciency gains from these techniques on suchtasks. We consider the degree to which the observed efﬁciency trends generalize to other AI tasks a highlyinteresting open question.115.3 Why new capabilities are probably a larger portion of progress than observed efﬁciency gainsAlexNet achieved performance that no system had previously achieved. We can try to reason about how muchcompute would have been required in scaling up previous systems to match AlexNet’s performance. Fromthis point of view, we believe AlexNet represented signiﬁcant progress in how much compute was requiredto achieve AlexNet-level performance. This analysis doesn’t attempt to quantify that progress because it’sless tractable. More generally, the ﬁrst time a capability is created, algorithmic breakthroughs may havebeen leveraged to dramatically reduce the resources that would have otherwise been needed. For instance,if we imagine simply scaling up a DQN [Mnih et al., 2013] model to play Go it could easily have needed1000x or more times as much compute to reach AlphaGo level. Such efﬁciency gains are not generallyobserved empirically, though they can be calculated with asymptotic analysis in some cases and estimatedwith empirical scaling laws in others [McCandlish et al., 2018].More formally, if we go far enough back in time, algorithmic progress takes us from brute force search tolower complexity classes, which is what enables capabilities of interest to be built at all. Within this zoomed-out view, the progress that went into making a capability possible at all, in total, yields an astronomicallylarger algorithmic efﬁciency improvement factor than directly observed efﬁciency improvements for capa-bilities that have recently been observed for the ﬁrst time. This limit analysis lends some support to theclaim that the rate of gain in algorithmic efﬁciency on a capability of interest might often be faster before acapability is observed.In the DQN and brute force examples described above, we ﬁnd it most helpful to start by thinking of a scalinglaw, a plot of performance vs training compute used. Our algorithmic efﬁciency data results are points we ﬁndmeaningful from those graphs, but sometimes similar comparisons would just yield an astronomical numberthat might not have much meaning. In such cases, we’d recommend analyzing a graph of the scaling law,since it contains the entire picture.While most researchers we’ve discussed the result with found the 44x number surprisingly high, because ofthis effect 44x may strongly underestimate algorithmic progress on image classiﬁcation during this period.When this analysis is discussed in the context of the relative importance of advancements in hardware andsoftware in AI progress, we think it’s critical to remember this limitation [Sutton, 2019].5.4 We estimate a 7.5 million times increase in the effective training compute available to the largestAI experiments between 2012 and 2018This section explains why we estimate there was a 7.5 million times increase in the effective training compute(in FLOPs) available to the largest AI experiments during this period. The reasoning behind our estimate isthat’s what we get when we take the product of the AI and Compute trend [Amodei & Hernandez, 2018](300,000x) and AlexNet efﬁciency trend found in this work (25x over this period3), and carefully considerwhat this product means. When we consider that we have more compute and that each unit of compute cando more, it becomes clear that these two trends are somehow multiplicative.This section is more speculative than the rest of the paper, but we think it’s important to explore the potentialimplications of our efﬁciency measurements. We believe a 7.5 million times estimate is somewhat defensiblewhen we:1.Narrowly deﬁne capabilities of interest so that 300,000x can be applied by deﬁnition.2.Deﬁne what we mean by effective compute.3.Discuss major considerations for why 25x could be an underestimate/overestimate for algorithmicprogress on capabilities of interest.Capabilities of interest:We deﬁne capabilities of interest as the training runs at close to the peak of sizethat was observed in 2018. Therefore it’s appropriate to apply the 300,000x from AI and Compute trendby deﬁnition. By 2020 such systems include AlphaZero, OpenAI Five, and NLP systems. This deﬁnitionhelps us avoid having to reason about what our measurements imply for distant domains. We have somemeasurements of progress for many of the capabilities of interest by the above deﬁnition. Though it’s possiblethere are unpublished results that ﬁt the capability of interest deﬁnition in relatively distant domains.3Through 2018 we use the 25x efﬁciency gains ShufﬂeNet represented rather than the 44x gains that EfﬁcientNetrepresented in 201912Effective compute:The conception we ﬁnd most useful is if we imagine how much more efﬁcient it is totrain models of interest in 2018 in terms of ﬂoating-point operations than it would have been to "scale up"training of 2012 models until they got to current capability levels. By "scale up," we mean more compute, theadditional parameters that come with that increased compute, the additional data required to avoid overﬁtting,and some tuning, but nothing more clever than that. We considered many other conceptions we found lesshelpful4.Why our overall take is that 25x is likely an underestimate for algorithmic progress on capabilities ofinterestOur overall take relies heavily on our observations in the domain of interest. We saw larger overallprogress in NLP and faster rates of short horizon progress for Go and Dota. In NLP we observed a 60xefﬁciency factor over 3 years for machine translation. Though we only have short-horizon progress for Goand Dota, we’d only need to see a modest 3x and 5x efﬁciency gains respectively over 5 years for their ratesto surpass the rate of progress on the vision task.On the other hand, algorithmic progress has a domain speciﬁc component, and it’s unclear how representativethe 25x is of the average efﬁciency progress in the broader domain of AI during this period. However, webelieve this effect is smaller than the effect in the opposite direction of not measuring the contribution ofnew capabilities like AlexNet, Seq2Seq, or original AlphaGo systems during this period. In section 5.3 weprovided arguments for why new capabilities might represent 100x or more algorithmic efﬁciency progress.To further clarify what drove changes in effective compute over this period, we split the AI and Compute trendinto Moore’s Law and increased spending/parallelization5. We graph an estimate for the effective computetrends in terms of these two components as well as progress in algorithmic efﬁciency in ﬁgure 5 below.We’re uncertain whether hardware or algorithmic progress actually had a bigger impact on effectivecompute available to large experiments over this period, because of the ways we’ve discussed in whichthe algorithmic estimate is conservative. Most researchers found the algorithmic efﬁciency progress to besurprisingly fast. So, regardless of one’s interpretation of what the AI and Compute trend implies aboutfuture AI progress, we believe our algorithmic efﬁciency estimates suggests:1.a modest update towards expecting faster progress along the edge of what’s possible for AI to do inthe short term.2.potentially large update on long term expectations about AI if the algorithmic efﬁciency on capabil-ities of interest continues to improve at a similar rate.Directly commenting on the likelihood of any of the 3 macro trends in ﬁgure 5 continuing in the futureis out of scope for this work.Making credible forecasts on such topics is a substantial enterprise, we’d ratheravoid here than give insufﬁcient treatment. Rather we present the evidence we see as relevant for a readerwho’d like to form their own expectations about extrapolating trends in algorithmic efﬁciency.Additional reasons why 44x over 7 years could be an underestimate for progress on AlexNet-levelalgorithmic efﬁciency:1.Only AlexNet was heavily optimized for AlexNet level performance. Models are generally tuned forperformance at convergence, not early learning. Our results were produced with minimum tuning forearly learning and AlexNet-level performance, and tuning them could only increase their efﬁciencygains.2.It’s our understanding that the re-implementation of AlexNet we used had a better initializationscheme than the original work. This effect adds another factor of conservativeness to our analysis.We expect future analysis to also be limited by this effect. This concern could be mitigated byresearchers publishing their learning curves in addition to training compute used to train.3.We don’t account for gains from being able to use lower precision computation [Gupta et al., 2015].4.We don’t account for gains from increased GPU utilization or improved GPU kernels.4Our initial thinking was in terms of what an elite team in 2012 could have done if given a large amount com-pute, but this was unobservable. We could make something similar observable by having a group of smart physi-cists/mathematicians that were unfamiliar with modern ML methods work on problems without access to modern results,but that would be very expensive to observe.5Increased spending and parallelization are coupled in that given ﬁxed time a researcher is limited by both (i) howmany concurrent GPU’s are available to them which is primarily a ﬁnancial question, and (ii) how many GPU’s canproductively be applied to the problem, which is a scientiﬁc question [McCandlish et al., 2018,Jia et al., 2018]13Figure 5The notion of effective compute allows us to combine AI and Compute trend and this result in asingle graph. These trends multiply as in addition to being able to do more with a ﬁxed amount of computenow, researchers have more of it. The AI and Compute trend is decomposed into a hardware efﬁciency gainestimate (original Moore’s Law) and money/parallelization [Moore, 1965,Amodei & Hernandez, 2018]. Thisestimate, as discussed in the body of this section, is more speculative than the rest of the paper, but we thinkit’s important to explore the potential implications of our efﬁciency measurements.5.5 It’s possible there’s an algorithmic Moore’s Law for optimization problems of interestThis work suggests that in high investment areas of AI algorithmic efﬁciency improvement is currently hav-ing a similar-sized effect as Moore’s Law has had on hardware efﬁciency in the past. Others have noticedcomparable algorithmic progress over decades in related domains like Chess, Go, SAT solving, and opera-tions research. In light of that past analysis, it’s less surprising that we’ve observed algorithmic efﬁciencygains this large on training to an AlexNet level of performance. The common thread here seems to be thatthese along with AI systems are all optimization problems of interest.Systematic measurement could make it clear whether an algorithmic equivalent to Moore’s Law in the domainof AI exists, and if it exists, clarify its nature. We consider this a highly interesting open question. Wesuspect we’re more likely to observe similar rates of efﬁciency progress on similar tasks. By similar taskswe mean within these sub-domains of AI, wide agreement of substantial progress, and comparable levelsof investment (compute and/or researcher time). It’s also unclear the degree to which general vs domainspeciﬁc gains would be the drivers of such progress, and how gains compound over long periods as the ﬁeldprogresses through several benchmarks. Problems of high investment might be be quite biased towards oneswe’re making progress on rather, where an ideal measure might focus on the questions that are seen as mostimportant.An AI equivalent to Moore’s Law would be harder to measure, because it’s not about progress on a singleproblem, it’s about progress on the frontier of optimization problems. Through that lens, it seems moreplausible we’ll see long term exponential progress on algorithmic efﬁciency for AI capabilities of interest ifour primary ﬁnding is an extension of an existing, long-running trend in progress on optimization problemsof interest.145.6 Research provides leading indicators of the future economic impact of AIThe eventual overall measure of AI research’s impact on the world will likely be economic. However, ittook past general-purpose technologies like electriﬁcation and information technology a surprisingly longtime to become widespread. From the start of information technolology era it was about 30 years beforepersonal computers were in more than half of US homes [Jovanovic & Rousseau, 2005] (similar timeline forpersonal computers). Analysis of past investments in basic research along 20-30 year timescales in domainslike computers indicates that there’s at least some tractability in foreseeing long term downstream impactsof technology like machine learning. Economic trends of AI are very informative, but measures of researchprogress are of particular interest to us as leading indicators of the eventual downstream economic and societalimpact.5.7 Major limitationsThe limitations of this work are discussed throughout, but the major ones are reiterated here:1.We only have a small number of algorithmic efﬁciency data points on a few tasks (Section 4).It’s unclear the degree to which we’d expect the rates of progress we’ve observed to generalize toalgorithmic efﬁciency progress on other AI task and domains. We consider this a highly interestingopen question that we discuss in Section 5.2.2.We believe our approach underestimates algorithmic progress, primarily because new capabilitiesare likely a larger portion of algorithmic progress than observed efﬁciency gains (Section 5.3). Thisweakness could be addressed by ﬁtting scaling laws to estimate the cost of prohibitively expensivetraining runs (Section 2.4).3.This analysis focuses on the ﬁnal training run cost for an optimized model rather than total devel-opment costs. Some algorithmic improvements make it easier to train a model by making the spaceof hyper-parameters that will train stably and get good ﬁnal performance much larger. On the otherhand, architecture searches increase the gap between the ﬁnal training run cost and total trainingcosts. We believe a quantitative analysis of these effects would be very informative, but it’s beyondthe scope of this paper.4.We don’t comment on the degree to which we believe efﬁciency trends will extrapolate, we merelypresent our results (Section 4) and the related work (Section 2) we think is relevant for someoneattempting to make such a prediction. Though we do comment on the implications if the trendspersist.6 ConclusionWe observe that hardware and algorithmic efﬁciency gains multiply and that neither factor is negligible overmeaningful horizons, which suggests that a good model of AI progress should integrate measures from both.We hope this work is helpful to those trying to understand, measure, and forecast AI progress in a variety ofsettings. We’ve observed that AI models for high interest tasks are getting cheaper to train at an exponentialrate faster than Moore’s Law. Even though we’re early on in applying this trend to AI, we were surprisedand inspired to learn that the original Moore’s Law was coined when integrated circuits had a mere 64transistors (6 doublings) [Moore, 1965] and naively extrapolating it out predicted personal computers andsmartphones (an iPhone 11 has 8.5 billion transistors). If we observe decades of exponential improvement inthe algorithmic efﬁciency of AI, what might it lead to? We’re not sure. That these results make us ask thisquestion is a modest update for us towards a future with powerful AI services and technology. Conversely, ifwe were to start only observing incremental gains (say 2x improvements every 5 years), we think that’d be ameaningful and widely understandable indicator that algorithmic progress had slowed down.More ambitiously, we hope that reporting on algorithmic efﬁciency improvements will become a strongand useful norm in the AI community. Improved performance is what AI algorithms are ultimately judgedby. Algorithmically efﬁcient models on benchmarks of interest are promising candidates for scaling upand potentially achieving overall top performance. Efﬁciency is straightforward to measure, as it’s just ameaningful slice of the learning curves that all experiments generate. Given these considerations and theprimacy of efﬁciency in measuring progress in computer science, we believe there’s a strong case for reportingon and tracking training efﬁciency states of the art over time.157 AcknowledgementsWe’d like to thank the following people helpful conversations and/or feedback on this paper: Dario Amodei,Jack Clark, Alec Radford, Paul Christiano, Sam McCandlish, Ilya Sutskever, Jacob Steinhardt, Jared Kaplan,Amanda Askell, John Schulman, Ryan Lowe, Tom Henighan, Jacob Hilton, Asya Bergal, Katja Grace, RyanCarey, Nicholas Joseph, and Geoffrey Irving.Thanks to Niki Parmar for providing the relevant points from the transformer learning curves [Vaswani et al.,2017].Also thanks to Mingxing Tan for providing the relevant points from EfﬁcientNet learning curves and runningan experiment with reduced warmup [Tan & Le, 2019].References[Amodei & Hernandez, 2018]Amodei, D. & Hernandez, D.

However, somehard to pin portion of the additional cost came from a changing environment, as there were balance changepatches approximately every 2 weeks during the original 10 month training period.B Calculations for efﬁciency improvements in image classiﬁcationTable 3FLOPs required to reach same AlexNet level accuracyteraﬂop/s-daysExperimentEpochsgigaﬂops/img(used)gigaﬂops/img(THOP)gigaﬂops/img(paper)367.7Vgg-11127.987.98-308.0Wide_ResNet_50711.4611.46-266.1AlexNet900.770.77-118.6Resnet-5083.863.86-118.5Resnet-3493.433.43-115.3ResNext_5074.294.29-97.9Resnet-18151.701.70-82.9DenseNet12182.702.70-73.1Squeezenet_v1_1530.360.36-61.4GoogLeNet82.002.00-24.0MobileNet_v1110.570.580.5720.2MobileNet_v2160.330.33-15.4ShufﬂeNet_v2_1_5x130.310.31-12.9ShufﬂeNet_v1_1x240.140.150.1410.8ShufﬂeNet_v2_1x200.140.150.146.0EfﬁcientNet-b040.39-0.39Wheretraining_flops=epochs⇤flops_per_image⇤images_per_epochWithimages_per_epoch=1.28⇤106and ateraflop/s day=1e12⇤(24⇤60⇤60s/day)
