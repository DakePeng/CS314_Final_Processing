References 67Executive Summary
In recent years, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) systems have signiﬁcantly improved and their capabilities have
expanded. In particular, AI systems called “generative models” have made great progress in automated
content creation, such as images generated from text prompts. One area of particularly rapid devel-
opment has been generative models that can produce original language, which may have beneﬁts for
diverse ﬁelds such as law and healthcare.
However, there are also possible negative applications of generative language models, or “language
models” for short. For malicious actors looking to spread propaganda—information designed to shape
perceptions to further an actor’s interest—these language models bring the promise of automating the
creation of convincing and misleading text for use in inﬂuence operations, rather than having to rely
on human labor. For society, these developments bring a new set of concerns: the prospect of highly
scalable—and perhaps even highly persuasive—campaigns by those seeking to covertly inﬂuence public
opinion.
This report aims to assess: how might language models change inﬂuence operations, and what steps
can be taken to mitigate these threats? This task is inherently speculative, as both AI and inﬂuence
operations are changing quickly.
Many ideas in the report were informed by a workshop convened by the authors in October 2021,
which brought together 30 experts across AI, inﬂuence operations, and policy analysis to discuss the
potential impact of language models on inﬂuence operations. The resulting report does not represent
the consensus of workshop participants, and mistakes are our own.
We hope this report is useful to disinformation researchers who are interested in the impact of emerging
technologies, AI developers setting their policies and investments, and policymakers preparing for social
challenges at the intersection of technology and society.
Potential Applications of Language Models to Inﬂuence Operations
We analyzed the potential impact of generative language models on three well-known dimensions of
inﬂuence operations—the actors waging the campaigns, the deceptive behaviors leveraged as tactics,
and the content itself—and conclude that language models could signiﬁcantly affect how inﬂuence
operations are waged in the future. These changes are summarized in Table 1.
The potential of language models to rival human-written content at low cost suggests that these mod-
els—like any powerful technology—may provide distinct advantages to propagandists who choose to
use them. These advantages could expand access to a greater number of actors, enable new tactics of
inﬂuence, and make a campaign’s messaging far more tailored and potentially effective.
Progress in Inﬂuence Operations and Critical Unknowns
Technical progress in language models is unlikely to halt, so any attempt to understand how language
models will affect future inﬂuence operations needs to take expected progress into account. Language
models are likely to become more usable (making it easier to apply models to a task), reliable (reduc-
ing the chance that models produce outputs with obvious errors), and efﬁcient (increasing the cost-
effectiveness of applying a language model for inﬂuence operations).

Table 1: How Language Models May Affect the ABCs of Inﬂuence Operations
These factors lead us to make a high conﬁdence judgment that language models will be useful for inﬂu-
ence operations in the future. The exact nature of their application, however, is unclear.
There are several critical unknowns that will impact how, and the extent to which, language models will
be adopted for inﬂuence operations. These unknowns include:
•Which new capabilities for inﬂuence will emerge as a side-effect of well-intentioned re-
search? The conventional research process—which targets more general language tasks—has
resulted in systems that could be applied to inﬂuence operations. New capabilities, like producing
longform persuasive arguments, could emerge in the future. These emergent capabilities are hard
to anticipate with generative models, but could determine the speciﬁc tasks propagandists will use
language models to perform.
•Will it be more effective to engineer speciﬁc language models for inﬂuence operations, rather
than apply generic ones? While most current models are built for generic tasks or tasks of sci-
entiﬁc or commercial value, propagandists could build or adapt models to be directly useful for
tasks like persuasion and social engineering. For example, a propagandist may be able to adapt a
smaller, less capable model in a process known as ﬁne-tuning. This is likely cheaper than building
a larger, more general model, though it is uncertain how much cheaper this would be. Further-
more, ﬁne-tuning a state-of-the-art model could make novel capabilities for inﬂuence easier for
propagandists to obtain.
1. Dimension categories drawn from Camille François’s “Disinformation ABC” framework.
2•Will actors make signiﬁcant investments in language models over time? If many actors invest
in, and create, large language models, it will increase the likelihood of propagandists gaining
access to language models (legitimately or via theft). Propagandists themselves could invest in
creating or ﬁne-tuning language models, incorporating bespoke data—such as user engagement
data—that optimizes for their goals.
•Will governments or speciﬁc industries create norms against using models for propaganda
purposes? Just as norms around use constrain the misuse of other technologies, they may con-
strain the application of language models to inﬂuence operations. A coalition of states who agree
not to use language models for propaganda purposes could impose costs on those that fail to abide.
On a substate level, research communities and speciﬁc industries could set norms of their own.
•When will easy-to-use tools to generate text become publicly available? Language models
still require operational know-how and infrastructure to use skillfully. Easy-to-use tools that pro-
duce tweet- or paragraph-length text could lead existing propagandists who lack machine learning
know-how to rely on language models.
Because these are critical possibilities that can change how language models may impact inﬂuence op-
erations, additional research to reduce uncertainty is highly valuable.
What Can Be Done to Mitigate the Potential Threat?
Building on the workshop we convened in October 2021, and surveying much of the existing literature,
we attempt to provide a kill chain framework for, and a survey of, the types of different possible mitiga-
tion strategies. Our aim is not to endorse speciﬁc mitigations, but to show how mitigations could target
different stages of the inﬂuence operation pipeline.

Table 2: Summary of Example Mitigations
The table above demonstrates that there is no silver bullet that will singularly dismantle the threat
of language models in inﬂuence operations. Some mitigations are likely to be socially infeasible, while
others will require technical breakthroughs. Others may introduce unacceptable downside risks. Instead,
to effectively mitigate the threat, a whole of society approach, marrying multiple mitigations, will likely
be necessary.
Furthermore, effective management will require a cooperative approach among different institutions
such as AI developers, social media companies, and government agencies. Many proposed mitigations
will have a meaningful impact only if these institutions work together. It will be difﬁcult for social media
companies to know if a particular disinformation campaign uses language models unless they can work
with AI developers to attribute that text to a model. The most radical mitigations—such as inserting
content provenance standards into the protocols of the internet—would require extreme coordination,
if they are desirable at all.
Perhaps most importantly, the mitigations we highlight require much more development, scrutiny, and
research. Evaluating their effectiveness and robustness is worthy of serious analysis.
41 Introduction
1.1 Motivation
In recent years, as the capabilities of generative artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) systems—otherwise known as
“generative models”—have improved, commentators have hypothesized about both the potential bene-
ﬁts and risks associated with these models. On the one hand, generative AI systems open up possibilities
in ﬁelds as diverse as healthcare, law, education, and science.2For example, generative models are be-
ing used to design new proteins,3generate source code,4and inform patients.5Yet the rapid speed of
technological progress has made it difﬁcult to adequately prepare for, or even understand, the poten-
tial negative externalities of these models. Early research has suggested that bias in model generations
could exacerbate inequalities, that models could displace human workers, and that, in the wrong hands,
models could be intentionally misused to cause societal harm.6
Concurrently, the last decade has seen a rise in political inﬂuence operations—covert or deceptive ef-
forts to inﬂuence the opinions of a target audience—online and on social media platforms speciﬁcally.
Researchers and social media platforms have documented hundreds of domestic and foreign inﬂuence
operations that are designed to mislead target audiences.7In the United States, the US intelligence com-
munity has publicly stated that foreign governments, including Russia and Iran, have waged inﬂuence
operations targeting the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections.8
In this paper, we focus on the overlap between these two trends. First, we ask: How can language mod-
els, a form of generative AI that can produce original text, impact the future of inﬂuence operations?
While several studies have addressed speciﬁc applications, we provide frameworks for thinking through
different types of changes and highlight critical unknowns that will affect the ultimate impact. By high-
lighting the technology’s current limitations and critical unknowns, we attempt to avoid threat inﬂation
or a sole focus on doomsday scenarios. After developing the threats, we ask: What are the possible
mitigation strategies to address these various threats?
Our paper builds on a yearlong collaboration between OpenAI, the Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO),
and Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET). In October 2021, we convened

to discuss the emerging threat as well as potential mitigations. This paper builds on the whitepaper that
we circulated to workshop participants, the workshop itself, and subsequent months of research. We
thank workshop participants for helping to clarify potential vectors of abuse and possible mitigations,
and note that our report does not necessarily reﬂect the views of the participants.
1.2 Threats and Mitigations
How can language models affect the future of inﬂuence operations?
To address this question, we build on the ABC model — Actors, Behaviors, and Content — from the
disinformation literature.9Language models can affect which actors wage inﬂuence operations, how
they do so, and what content they produce.
•Actors: Language models drive down the cost of generating propaganda—the deliberate attempt
to shape perceptions and direct behavior to further an actor’s interest10—so more actors may ﬁnd it
attractive to wage these campaigns.11Likewise, propagandists-for-hire that automate production
of text may gain new competitive advantages.
•Behavior: Recent AI models can generate synthetic text that is highly scalable, and often highly
persuasive.12Inﬂuence operations with language models will become easier to scale, and more ex-
pensive tactics (e.g., generating personalized content) may become cheaper. Moreover, language
models could enable new tactics to emerge—like real-time content generation in one-on-one chat-
bots.
•Content: Language models may create more impactful messaging compared to propagandists who
lack linguistic or cultural knowledge of their target. They may also make inﬂuence operations less
discoverable, since they create new content with each generation.
When considering these predicted changes, it is also important to remember that AI development is
progressing rapidly. We highlight critical unknowns that will impact the future of inﬂuence operations,
including how models will improve, whether new capabilities will emerge as a product of scale, whether
actors invest in AI for inﬂuence operations, and whether norms emerge that constrain different actors
from automating their inﬂuence campaigns.
What mitigations could reduce the impact of AI-enabled inﬂuence operations?
After laying out potential threats, we also consider the range of possible mitigation strategies to inﬂuence
operations with language models. We develop a framework that categorizes mitigations based on a kill

6chain framework. To effectively wage an inﬂuence operation with a language model, propagandists
would require (1) that a model is built (by themselves or others), (2) that they have access to the
model, (3) that they have the means of disseminating content they produce, and (4) that the information
spread impacts the target. Each of these steps—model design and construction, model access, content
dissemination, and belief formation—represents a possible stage for intervention.
1.3 Scope and Limitations
This paper focuses on a particular application of AI (language models) to inﬂuence operations, but it
does not focus on other AI models, other forms of information control, or speciﬁc actors. As described
above, generative models include models that can create a range of output. The idea of AI-generated
“deepfaked” images or video has been in the public consciousness for several years now.13Recently, for
example, a low-quality deepfake video of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky purportedly telling
Ukrainian soldiers to lay down their arms and surrender circulated on social media.14Higher-quality
deepfake videos have also gained traction in the past.15We focus on generative text, rather than videos,
images, or multimodal models for three reasons: ﬁrst, because text is relatively underexplored (com-
pared to images and videos) in the disinformation literature, second, because text seems particularly dif-
ﬁcult to distinguish as AI-generated, and third, because access to these capabilities is diffusing quickly.16
While multimodal models are also new and relatively underexplored, they are not our primary focus.
Our focus on how language models can be used for inﬂuence operations scopes our study more nar-
rowly than information control writ large. State and non-state actors engage in a variety of information
control behaviors, ranging from censorship to manipulating search algorithms. One recent framework
categorizes different forms of digital repression, and notes that these techniques are as distinct as “on-
line disinformation campaigns, digital social credit schemes, private online harassment campaigns by
lone individuals, and regime violence against online political actors.”17While we take digital repression
seriously, a fuller examination of categories of digital repression other than covert propaganda cam-
paigns—and how those categories are affected by AI—falls outside our scope.
Our scope is relevant to a variety of state, substate, and private actors; we do not focus on any one actor
speciﬁcally. Although the intentions and capabilities of speciﬁc actors is relevant to assess the likelihood

16. This is true on two levels: ﬁrst, the set of institutions that have trained their own highly capable language model from
scratch has expanded rapidly over the past two years. Second, public access to many of those models has widened over time.
For instance, while GPT-3 was initially released behind a sharply restricted API, it has since considerably loosened its access
restrictions, allowing a larger number of people to use the model. And other, only slightly less capable models have been made
fully public, with no use restrictions at all. See Section 3.2.

7of future use of language models for inﬂuence operations, our focus is primarily on the technology and
trends. For example, we describe tactics that could be deployed in a range of settings, rather than
applications of AI to inﬂuence operations in highly speciﬁc political contexts. Additional research can
expand on this paper to consider how speciﬁc groups may (or may not) use different language models
for the types of inﬂuence campaigns we describe.
A paper on how current and future technological developments may impact the nature of inﬂuence
operations is inherently speculative. Today, we know that it is possible to train a model and output its
content—without notifying social media users—on platforms. Likewise, existing research shows that
language models can produce persuasive text, including articles that survey respondents rate as credible
as real news articles.18However, many of the future-oriented possibilities we discuss in the report
are possibilities rather than inevitabilities, and we do not claim any one path will necessarily come to
fruition. Similarly, our goal in this report is not to explicitly endorse any one mitigation, or any speciﬁc
set of mitigations. Rather, we aim to lay out a range of possibilities that researchers and policymakers
can consider in greater detail.
We also recognize that our backgrounds may result in a biased perspective: several authors work for
AI developers directly, and we do not represent many of the communities that AI-enabled inﬂuence
operations may affect. We encourage future research to pay particular attention to likely differential
impacts and to conduct surveys of those most at risk or susceptible to AI-enabled campaigns.
1.4 Outline of the Report
The remainder of this report proceeds as follows: In Section 2, we provide an overview of inﬂuence
operations, introducing key terminology, describing what inﬂuence operations are and how they are
carried out, as well as providing a framework to distinguish between impact based on content and
downstream impact based on trust. We focus primarily on online inﬂuence operations, in part because
they are a frequent vector for text-based campaigns. In Section 3, we overview recent development in
generative models and describe current access and diffusion of capabilities. In Section 4, we tie these
two concepts together by examining how recent generative models could affect the future of inﬂuence
operations. We describe how language models will impact the actors, behavior, and content of existing
campaigns, and we highlight expected developments in the technology and critical unknowns.
The longest section of this paper is Section 5, where we move from threats to mitigations. We classify
a range of potential mitigations along four key stages in the AI-to-target pipeline: model construction,
model access, content dissemination, and belief formation. We conclude in Section 6 with overarching
takeaways. We suggest that newer generative models have a high probability of being adopted in future
inﬂuence operations, and that no reasonable mitigations can be expected to fully prevent this. However,
we also suggest that a combination of multiple mitigation strategies may make an important difference
and that many of these mitigations may require the formation of new collaborations between social
media platforms, AI companies, government agencies, and civil society actors. In addition, we highlight
several avenues for future research.

82 Orienting to Inﬂuence Operations
Following Russia’s interference in the 2016 US election, the study of online inﬂuence operations and
disinformation has grown dramatically. In this section, we begin with an overview of inﬂuence opera-
tions—what they are, why they are carried out, and the types of impacts they may (or may not) have.
2.1 What Are Inﬂuence Operations, and Why Are They Carried Out?
While there is some debate about what activities constitute an inﬂuence operation,19in this report, we
deﬁne inﬂuence operations as covert ordeceptive efforts to inﬂuence the opinions of a target audience.20
Of note, our deﬁnition is agnostic to the truth of the message (whether the content spread is true or
false) and the identity of the actor spreading it.
Inﬂuence operations include operations that intend to activate people who hold particular beliefs, to
persuade an audience of a particular viewpoint, and /or to distract target audiences. The logic of dis-
traction rests on the idea that propagandists are in competition for user attention on social media plat-
forms, which is already spread thin.21If propagandists can distract target audiences from an unfavorable
narrative taking shape on social media—by spreading alternative theories or diluting the information
environment—they could successfully absorb user attention without necessarily persuading them.
Inﬂuence operations can come in many forms and use an array of tactics, but a few unifying themes
tie many of them together. A recent report studying political inﬂuence operations in the Middle East22
found that operations often exhibited one of several tactics:
• Attempts to cast one’s own government, culture, or policies in a positive light
• Advocacy for or against speciﬁc policies
• Attempts to make allies look good and rivals look bad to third-party countries
• Attempts to destabilize foreign relations or domestic affairs in rival countries
In several of these cases, the accounts executing the operation masqueraded as locals expressing dis-
content with their government or certain political ﬁgures. Social media manipulation operations often
employ this tactic of digital agents of inﬂuence , hiding the identity of the true information source from

9the target audience.23Russia’s Internet Research Agency (IRA) accounts, for example, pretended to be
Black Americans and conservative American activists, and directly messaged members of each targeted
community. Identifying these inauthentic accounts often relies on subtle cues: a misused idiom, a re-
peated grammatical error, or even the use of a backtick ( /grave.ts1) where an authentic speaker would use an
apostrophe (‘). State-level adversarial actors often run a combination of tactics, leveraging their own
employees or outsourcing to digital mercenaries.
Since 2016, Meta and Twitter have removed well over a hundred social media inﬂuence operations,
stemming from dozens of different countries.24These operations often include persona creation (cre-
ating fake identities to spread a message), fake news properties, and inauthentic ampliﬁcation efforts.
But inﬂuence operations have also expanded signiﬁcantly beyond Facebook and Twitter and into al-
ternative platforms, small group settings, and encrypted spaces.25Reporting from the New York Times ,
in hand with Israeli disinformation researchers, documented how “Iranian agents had inﬁltrated small
[Israeli ]WhatsApp groups, Telegram channels and messaging apps” to spread polarizing content.26At
times these inﬂuence operations display novel ingenuity, leveraging platform policies in an adversarial
fashion. A campaign supporting the Tanzanian government that was removed by Twitter in 2021, for
example, used false claims of copyright reporting to target Tanzanian activists’ accounts.27
Much of the recent research and public attention on inﬂuence operations focuses on foreign campaigns—where
governments or citizens in one country target citizens in a different country.28But, as the Tanzania ex-
ample shows, inﬂuence operations can also be domestically focused. Political actors frequently spread
covert propaganda targeting their citizens in order to boost their popularity, undermine that of an op-
ponent, or sow confusion in the political system. In 2020, Facebook suspended fake personas spreading
polarizing content about Brazilian politics that were linked to Brazilian lawmakers as well as President
Jair Bolsonaro and his sons, Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro and Senator Flavio Bolsonaro.29In fact,
23. Russia, for example, leverages personas that speak as if they are members of the targeted communities. Some of the
personas produce short-form content, such as tweets and Facebook posts. Others masquerade as journalists and write long-
form narrative content that they then submit to legitimate publications or publish on Russian self-administered proxy “media
outlets” or “think tanks.” For examples in the Russia context, see Renee DiResta and Shelby Grossman, Potemkin Pages &
Personas: Assessing GRU Online Operations, 2014-2019 (Stanford Internet Observatory, 2019), https: //cyber.fsi.stanford.edu /

10many commentators believe that domestic , not foreign, inﬂuence operations are the most worrisome.30
Inﬂuence operations have additionally been deployed to take sides in intraparty politics,31and, in the
case of several attributed to the Chinese Communist Party, to target diaspora populations.32
2.2 Inﬂuence Operations and Impact
Inﬂuence operations can have impact based on their speciﬁc content or focus (e.g., through persuasion),
or by eroding community trust in the information environment overall.
In current inﬂuence operations, direct impact from content is sometimes limited by resources, quality
of the message, and detectability of the operation. These factors may matter differently depending on
the goals of the operator—for instance, if operators are looking only to distract instead of to convince
targets of a speciﬁc viewpoint, the quality of each individual message is likely far less signiﬁcant. In
theory, however, these constraints may be partially overcome by language models in the future.
Having an effect on trust in an information environment depends less on the substance and more on
creating the perception that any given message might be inauthentic or manipulative. Even if inﬂuence
operations do not change someone’s views, they may lead people to question whether the content they
see from even credible sources is in fact real, potentially undermining faith in democratic and epistemic
institutions more broadly.
2.2.1 Impact Based on Content
An inﬂuence operation could have impact based on content if it (1) persuades someone of a particular
viewpoint or reinforces an existing one, (2) distracts them from ﬁnding or developing other ideas, or
(3) distracts them from carving out space for higher quality thought at all. Often the goal is simply
to distract from information that is potentially harmful to the operator.33As advertisers, media outlets,
and platforms already compete for viewers, distraction operations can often exploit and exacerbate
such preexisting attention competitions to crowd out important information with attention-grabbing,
irrelevant information. Distraction operations therefore do not require a target to be persuaded by the
information spread, but rather that a target not be persuaded by (or even consider) some other piece of
information.
There are both historical and contemporary examples where the impact of an inﬂuence operation can
be clearly measured or traced. For example, in the 1980s during the HIV epidemic, the Soviet Union
waged an inﬂuence operation spreading the claim that the United States government created the virus

11in a lab. One 2005 study found that 27% of African Americans still believed this claim.34In 2016, the
IRA used manipulative agents of inﬂuence on Facebook to provoke real-world conﬂict by organizing
protests and counter-protests outside the Islamic Da’wah Center in Houston.35The impact is relatively
easy to trace here because the protests would not have occurred without the IRA’s activity. A recent
literature review examining social science research on the effects of inﬂuence operations found “strong
evidence that long-term campaigns on mass media have measurable effects on beliefs and consequential
behaviors such as voting and risk-taking combat.” While noting that evidence remains sparse, the study
also found there is “some evidence that social media activity by exceptionally inﬂuential individuals and
organizations can stoke low-level violence.”36
However, the impact and effectiveness of inﬂuence operations are usually difﬁcult to measure. Disin-
formation researchers typically focus on engagement metrics—things like clicks and shares—which are
inadequate proxy measures of social inﬂuence.37In cases where a clear comparison group does not
exist, it can be difﬁcult to determine how viewing or engaging with content translates into important
political outcomes like polarization or votes. While platforms make attributions and provide researchers
with data about taken-down inﬂuence operations, researchers still have limited visibility into the impact
on users or their subsequent behavior after engagement. Furthermore, not all inﬂuence operations are
detected. Even propagandists who attempt to measure their own impact can face challenges given multi-
causality and difﬁculties in measuring opinion change over time. As scholars have noted, this ambiguity
has historically contributed to intelligence agencies inﬂating the impact of their inﬂuence operations for
bureaucratic gain.38
Despite these measurement challenges, some features clearly limit the impact of existing campaigns,
including resources, content quality and messaging, and detectability. We outline these limitations below,
and discuss in the following section how generative models may help overcome these barriers.
•Resources: Like marketing campaigns, the success of an inﬂuence operation is a function of re-
sources and the ability to get the desired content in front of one’s target. How many propagandists
does a political actor hire to write content? How many social media accounts can they obtain to
fake popularity? Low-resourced campaigns are less likely to get their desired content in front of

37. For example, researchers conducted a study comparing Twitter users who interacted with content from the IRA with
those who did not. The study found “no substantial effects of interacting with Russian IRA accounts on the affective attitudes
of Democrats and Republicans who use Twitter frequently toward each other, their opinions about substantial political issues,
or their engagement with politics on Twitter in late 2017.” Christopher A. Bail et al., “Assessing the Russian Internet Research

12the target or to garner media coverage.39
•Quality and Message of Content: People are less likely to be persuaded by messaging if it strongly
counters their established attitude or if the arguments are poorly constructed or poorly reasoned.40
Campaigns with messaging that disconﬁrms targets’ attitudes, does not successfully blend in with
a target’s information environment, and provides low-quality arguments are, all else being equal,
less likely to be effective.41
•Detectability: Finally, operations that are quickly discovered are less likely to have an impact.
Social media platforms and independent researchers actively search for inﬂuence operations, and
platforms remove them in order to limit their reach. In fact, awareness that these operations may
be removed can itself shape the behavior of propagandists, leading them to pursue distraction
operations if they believe persona development—which requires longer-term investment but can
be more persuasive to observers—is not worth the effort.42
It is helpful to keep these limitations in mind as we consider the role that language models can play in
inﬂuence campaigns. If they can overcome existing limitations, then they may pose a signiﬁcant issue
for the information environment. We discuss this further in Section 4.
2.2.2 Downstream Impact Based on Trust
The second way that inﬂuence operations can have an impact is by eroding trust. Degrading societal
trust does not necessarily require high quality efforts: even when inﬂuence campaigns are detected,
their appearance, especially at scale, may cause users to become suspicious of other, authentic sources.43
Propagandists often aim to exploit vulnerabilities in their target’s mental shortcuts for establishing trust,
especially where information technologies make it harder to evaluate the trustworthiness of sources. By
manipulating public perceptions of reputation, harnessing fake or misleading credentials and testimo-
nials, or tampering with photographic and video evidence, inﬂuence operators can serve to undermine
39. Beyond simply expanding the size of a campaign, greater resources may help operators target their content to a wider
range of people. Research on the 2016 election suggests that fake news consumption was heavily concentrated, with only 1%
of Twitter users exposed to 80% of fake news. Nir Grinberg et al., “Fake news on Twitter during the 2016 U.S. presidential
election,” Science 363, no. 6425 (January 25, 2019): 374–378, ISSN: 10959203, https: //doi.org /10.1126 /science.aau2706

ISSN: 0360-3989, https: //doi.org /10.1111 /J.1468-2958.2007.00290.X.
41. However, as discussed above, note that the importance of this factor depends on the goals of the operator. If the goal is
pure distraction, having high-quality posts may be far less signiﬁcant than if the operator is aiming to actually persuade.
42. Josh A. Goldstein and Renee DiResta, “China’s Fake Twitter Accounts Are Tweeting Into the Void,” Foreign Policy , De-
cember 15, 2021, https: //foreignpolicy.com /2021 /12/15/china-twitter-trolls-ccp-influence-operations-astroturfing /. We
recognize that, in some cases, inﬂuence operators desire their efforts to be detected in order to stir worry among a target pop-
ulation. However, because many inﬂuence operations seek to directly change opinions, and universally easy detection would
undermine efforts to stir worry, we treat lower detectability as desirable to propagandists.
43. Recent research suggests that educating people about deepfakes makes them more likely to believe that real videos they
subsequently see are also fakes; see John Ternovski, Joshua Kalla, and Peter Aronow, “The Negative Consequences of Informing
Voters about Deepfakes: Evidence from Two Survey Experiments,” Journal of Online Trust and Safety 1, no. 2 (February 2022),
ISSN: 2770-3142, https: //doi.org /10.54501 /JOTS.V1I2.28. Politicians may also beneﬁt from the “liar’s dividend” by falsely
claiming that real events that paint them in a critical light are fake news or deepfakes. See Robert Chesney and Danielle Citron,
“Deep Fakes: A Looming Challenge for Privacy, Democracy, and National Security,” California Law Review 107, no. 6 (2019):
1753, https: //doi.org /10.15779 /Z38RV0D15J.
13trust beyond the speciﬁc topic of their campaign.44Lower societal trust can reduce a society’s ability to
coordinate timely responses to crises, which may be a worthy goal for adversarial actors in and of itself.
In turn, lower societal trust also creates a more favorable operating environment for propagandists to
pursue their objectives. Preexisting polarization and fragmentation in society undercut the ability of
honest actors to establish broad credibility, and can give inﬂuence operators a foothold to tailor their
messaging to narrower audiences, sow division, and degrade social capital and institutional trust. Low
general trust undermines the norms that enable people and organizations to interact and cooperate
without extensive rules and processes to govern their behavior.45

technologically-advanced world .
45. Lower societal trust also increases transaction costs. In the economy, this decreases the efﬁciency of markets, and in
government, it incentivizes regulatory overreach and accordingly bureaucratic growth that can entrench interests and degrade
institutional agility. See Michael J. Mazarr et al., The Emerging Risk of Virtual Societal Warfare: Social Manipulation in a Changing

143 Recent Progress in Generative Models
Understanding the present state of generative models is helpful for addressing their potential role in
inﬂuence operations. This section introduces generative models to disinformation researchers and poli-
cymakers, and will likely be familiar to those in the machine learning (ML) community.
3.1 What Are Generative Models, and How Are They Built?
In the last decade, research in AI has improved the ability to automate the production of digital content,
including images, video, audio, and text. These new generative AI models can learn to understand the
patterns in a given type of data—like text in the English language or the audio waveforms comprising
songs—in order to sample new items of that type and produce original outputs. In a wide number of
domains, progress in generative models over the past decade has moved shockingly quickly and produced
surprisingly realistic output, as illustrated in Table 3 and Figures 1, 2, and 3.
2011 2020
The meaning of life is the tradition of the an-
cient human reproduction: it is less favorable

gle expression of life. It is present in the in-
ﬁnity of forms and phenomena that exist in all
aspects of the universe.
Table 3: Generative text model outputs in 2011 versus 2020.46
These machine language systems consist of large artiﬁcial neural networks47and are “trained” via a
trial-and-error process over mountains of data.48The neural networks are rewarded when their algo-
rithmically generated words or images resemble the next word in a text document or a face from an
image dataset.49The hope is that after many rounds of trial and error, the systems will have picked
up general features of the data they are trained on. After training, these generative models can be
repurposed to generate entirely new synthetic artifacts.
46. The 2011 text was generated from Ilya Sutskever, James Martens, and Geoffrey Hinton, “Generating Text with Recurrent
Neural Networks,” ed. Lisa Gooter and Tobias Scheffer, Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Machine Learning ,
2011, https: //icml.cc /2011/papers /524_icmlpaper.pdf. The 2020 text was generated using the 175B GPT-3 model.
47. Artiﬁcial neural networks are a class of statistical models that are loosely inspired by biological brains. For a technical
introduction discussing the role of neural networks in modern machine learning, see the Introduction in Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua
Bengio, and Aaron Courville, Deep Learning (MIT Press, 2016), https: //www.deeplearningbook.org /. For an introduction for

48. For example, HuggingFace’s BigScience project is using a training dataset of 1.5 TB (see “Building a TB Scale Multilingual
Dataset for Language Modeling,” Hugging Face BigScience, https: //bigscience.huggingface.co /blog/building- a- tb- scale-
multilingual-dataset-for-language-modeling); the original GPT-3 project (published in 2021) used a ﬁltered dataset of 570 GB;
the largest DeepMind’s Gopher model saw about 1.3 TB of text. The text is composed via sources like web crawls, Wikipedia,
scanned books, and news articles.
49. Other methods to train generative models are also in development. For example, diffusion models have been applied
to text-to-image generation; see Aditya Ramesh et al., “Hierarchical Text-Conditional Image Generation with CLIP Latents,”
arxiv:2204.06125 [cs.CV ], April 2022, https: //doi.org /10.48550 /arxiv.2204.06125.

Creating generative models from scratch involves two steps. The ﬁrst is to take a neural network and train
it on an immense amount of raw data. This training process automatically adjusts the many (sometimes
more than hundreds of billions) “parameters” of the neural network, which are somewhat analogous
to synapses in biological brains. This step culminates in a system that is quite general (it can do many
different tasks) and capable (it can do these tasks well),50but that may be difﬁcult to use for speciﬁc
tasks or that may still lack certain specialized skills. The optional second—and much cheaper—step is
to reﬁne this foundation model by further training (or “ﬁne-tuning”) it on small amounts of task-speciﬁc
data. Fine-tuning can extend a model’s capabilities—for example, a model can be ﬁne-tuned to imitate
complex human behaviors like following instructions—or it can be used to train domain-speciﬁc skills
in smaller models.
Training a state-of-the-art, large generative model from scratch in 2022 can involve costs that are at
least tens of millions of dollars.54However, it is becoming less expensive to reach near state-of-the-art
performance: while it originally cost millions of dollars to train GPT-3 in 2020, in 2022 MosaicML was
able to train a model from scratch to reach GPT-3 level performance for less than $500k.55Because of

double-digit millions of dollars.

17this upfront cost, many developers will choose to ﬁne-tune an existing model for their task. This allows
them to leverage the general capabilities of the foundation model—imbued from pre-training—at lower
cost.56
Recent advances in generative models have been driven by three major developments: (1) the explosion
of training data in the form of human language available on the internet (and in curated datasets of
internet or user-generated content); (2) improvements in the underlying neural network models and
the algorithms used to train them; and (3) rapid growth in the amount of computational power that
leading actors have used to train these models, which allows for the creation of larger, more sophisticated
models. In many cutting-edge applications, acquiring sufﬁcient computational power to train a model is
the most expensive of these components, and the relative capability of different models tends to roughly
correspond to how much computational power was used to train them.57

Table 4: Summary of Training Requirements and Areas of Recent Improvement of Language Models
Generative language models that “understand” and produce language are the central focus of this re-
port.58In principle, a system that can receive and output arbitrary text can perform every task that is
expressible via text. Interacting with a language model is, in some sense, like interacting with a remote
employee over a textual interface. While current language models are not nearly at human level, they
have made great strides in their generality and capability59. For example, not only can the same system
(the hypothetical “employee”) carry out the task of classifying tweets as positive or negative sentiment,
but it can also generate tweets, write summaries, carry on conversations, write rudimentary source code,
and so on.60
While impressive, current generative language models have many limitations. Even the most sophisti-
cated systems struggle to maintain coherence over long passages, have a tendency to make up false or
absurd statements of fact, and are limited to a generation length of about 1,500 words. In addition,

18models perform worse as they are given more cognitively complex tasks: for instance, asking a genera-
tive model to write a few conservative-leaning tweets on a topic will likely result in better outputs than
asking a model to rewrite an existing news story in a way that subtly promotes a conservative narrative.61
While these limitations are noteworthy, progress in generative models is both rapid and hard to predict.
The capabilities of current models should be considered lower bounds on how realistic generative model
outputs can become, and it is not clear where the relevant upper bound is—if it exists.
To overcome these limitations, ongoing research targets improvements in data, algorithms, and compu-
tational power. For example, some research attempts to improve the quality of the data that the neural
network ingests. One way to do so is by collecting data from human domain experts or demonstrators
of the desired capability.62Improvements in neural network architectures and new training strategies
to imbue the model with improved capability can lead to better algorithms. And, of course, training
models on more powerful supercomputers increases the amount of computational power available to
the model.
3.2 Access and Diffusion of Generative Models
A sizable number of organizations have developed advanced language models. These models are ac-
cessible on a spectrum from fully public to fully private. A small number of models are fully public,
meaning that anyone can download and use them to produce outputs in a way that can no longer be
monitored by the models’ designers. The largest openly downloadable model as of September 2022
(measured by the number of parameters in the neural network model) is BLOOM by HuggingFace’s Big-
Science project—a 175 billion- parameter model openly released in July 2022. However, algorithmic
improvements have also enabled much smaller open source models that rival or exceed BLOOM and
GPT-3 on several capabilities.63
Other models have been kept fully private, with no means for non-developers to access or use the model.
DeepMind’s Gopher (280 billion parameters) and Microsoft and Nvidia’s Megatron-Turing NLG (530 bil-
lion parameters, but not fully trained)—both of which were created primarily for research purposes—fall
into this category. As mentioned previously, the relative capabilities of different language models tends
to correspond to the amount of computational power used to train them, and more computational power
generally (though not always) means a larger model with more parameters.64It is therefore worth em-
phasizing that the largest fully public model is two to three times smaller than the largest currently
existing private models. However, this may change soon if more developers open-source their models
or a model is leaked.

Bowen Baker et al., “Learning to Play Minecraft with Video PreTraining (VPT),” OpenAI Blog, June 23, 2022, https: //openai.

64. Advances in sparsity and retrieval methods are two ways that the number of parameters can come apart from both the
computational power used to train the model and the model’s capabilities. See Noam Shazeer et al., “Outrageously Large
Neural Networks: The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer,” 5th International Conference on Learning Representations,
ICLR 2017 - Conference Track Proceedings , January 2017, https: //doi.org /10.48550 /arxiv.1701.06538; Sebastian Borgeaud

//doi.org /10.48550 /arxiv.2112.04426.
19A third category of models attempt to balance public and private access. Meta AI gave some external
researchers copies of its 175 billion-parameter language model while requiring them to sign a license
that banned certain use cases.65Another method allows for users to sign up for certain types of access
through an application programming interface (API). An API-based access regime allows AI developers
to commercialize access to their model, track model usage, and impose restrictions on both who can
access the model and how they can use it. GPT-3, Jurassic-1, and Cohere Extremely Large, for instance,
are all currently accessible via an API.66Keeping models behind an API allows developers a great deal
of discretion regarding the conditions under which their model can be accessed.67Organizations that
use an API-based access regime ensure that users can submit queries to a model and receive outputs,
but also that users cannot directly see or download the model itself,68which means that they cannot
ﬁne-tune it for their own speciﬁc applications. An AI provider may also choose to support API-based
ﬁne-tuning, which would allow the AI developer to monitor and restrict certain ﬁne-tuning use cases.69
Table 5 includes an illustrative list of the most capable current (publicly known, as of September 2022)
language models that vary across access regime, primary language of output, and sizes. There are several
key takeaways that characterize the current state of model diffusion.
First, anyone can access a number of moderately capable models that have been made fully public, but
the most capable models remain either private or kept behind monitorable APIs. While currently publicly
available models may not be as powerful as the largest private models, they can likely be ﬁne-tuned to
perform remarkably well on speciﬁc tasks at far less cost than training a large model from scratch. This
type of ﬁne-tuning might not be within the reach of most individuals, but it is likely feasible for any
nation-state as well as many non-state actors, such as ﬁrms and wealthy individuals.71
Second, in addition to cutting-edge models from AI developers like Google (US) and DeepMind (UK),
several international actors have developed highly capable models likely motivated by commercial in-
terests and as a matter of national prestige. For example, Inspur’s Yuan 1.0, a 245 billion-parameter
Chinese-language model, and Naver’s HyperClova, a 204 billion-parameter Korean-language model,

67. However, because external researchers do not have access to the raw models from these APIs, API-based access regimes
may make it more difﬁcult for researchers to replicate and improve the private models.
68. API-based models may not be immune to manipulation or theft by adversaries. Model inversion attacks can allow an
adversary to potentially steal a model by querying an API many times; see Florian Tramer et al., “Stealing Machine Learning
Models via Prediction APIs,” 25th USENIX Security Symposium (Austin, TX; USENIX Security 16) , 2016, 601–618, https: //www.
usenix.org /conference /usenixsecurity16 /technical-sessions /presentation /tramer. However, these methods are expensive and
have not been demonstrated to work in practice against a foundation model API.

have matched and exceeded the size of GPT-3 and likely offer similarly impressive capabilities.72While
access to PanGu- a, HyperClova, and Wu Dao 2.0 looks likely to remain partially or fully restricted, other
models are public. For example, the Russian Yalm 100 billion-parameter model is openly available
through code repositories on GitHub and /or HuggingFace.73Some of the Beijing Academy of Artiﬁcial
Intelligence’s (BAAI) WuDao models are directly downloadable from their website.74
Third, these international actors have optimized their models for their national languages. For example,
the Yuan 1.0 model excels in Chinese-language tasks. While per-language performance can be approxi-
mated by the proportion of training data that is in a particular language, models can also perform well
at producing text in multiple languages or translating between them—if the model is trained on enough
data from multiple languages. This trend of language-speciﬁc optimization suggests that if these mod-
els are applied to inﬂuence operations, they will be most able to target populations speaking speciﬁc
languages that are well-represented in a particular model’s training data.

214 Generative Models and Inﬂuence Operations
This section marries the previous sections’ emphases on inﬂuence operations and generative models.
We build on the existing but nascent body of research on AI-generated inﬂuence campaigns in two
steps. First, we introduce the ABC framework—actors, behaviors, and content—that is well-known
among disinformation researchers, and describe how generative models may transform each of these
three facets.75Then, we examine expected developments and critical unknowns in the ﬁeld of machine
learning that will impact the role that generative models can play in inﬂuence operations. For each
expected development, we describe the current state of technology, expected improvements, and the
implications such improvements would have for the future of inﬂuence campaigns.
4.1 Language Models and the ABCs of Disinformation
In this paper, we build on the “ABC” model, a popular model in the disinformation ﬁeld, that distinguishes
between key manipulation vectors in disinformation campaigns.76“A,” for actors , references the fact that
the entity behind a campaign is often not what it seems; for example, the accounts in a conversation may
look like Black Lives Matter activists, but in reality may be state-linked actors using fake accounts in active
misdirection. “B” is for behavior , and refers to howpropagandists wage their campaigns—the techniques
used to perpetuate disinformation, such as the use of automation or attempts to manipulate engagement
statistics via click farms.77“C” alludes to the content itself, the substance (narrative, memes, etc.) that
the accounts are attempting to launder or amplify; this third facet of disinformation campaigns is perhaps
the most visible to the public, and media will highlight the substance in its coverage.78Although, as
discussed in the Section 1, we are focused on inﬂuence operations, not disinformation exclusively, this
model helps characterize potential changes that may arise due to language models.
One of the reasons that platforms and researchers assess all three dimensions—the actors, behaviors, and
content—when evaluating an inﬂuence operation is that at times one facet may be perfectly authentic
even within an overall manipulative campaign. Authentic content, for example, may be inauthentically
ampliﬁed with paid or automated engagement, or by actors who are not what they seem. Similarly,
entirely authentic actors—domestic political activists, perhaps—may use inauthentic automation. In
discussing the potential impact of AI on future inﬂuence or disinformation campaigns, we therefore
consider its potential for transforming each of the three factors. We believe that generative models

77. Click farms refers to labor hired to manually click on content online on behalf of their employers. They display some
online patterns of genuine internet users since they are humans, allowing them to avoid bot detection, while still driving up
content views and interactions.
78. Deepfake videos have already been used for phishing campaigns and the harassment of journalists. Some have suggested
deepfakes may be used to develop crisis scenarios, whether by faking government directives, discrediting candidates for public
ofﬁce, or pretending to keep hostage soldiers. See, for example, Kishalaya Kundu, “Criminals Used AI To Clone Company

22will improve the content, reduce the cost, and increase the scale of campaigns; that they will introduce
new forms of deception like tailored propaganda; and that they will widen the aperture for political
actors who consider waging these campaigns. In Table 6, we summarize possible changes to the actors,
behavior, and content due to language models, and describe these changes in further depth below.

Table 6: How Language Models May Inﬂuence the ABCs of Inﬂuence Operations
4.1.1 Actors: Outsourced Execution & Proliferation of Propagandists
One limitation on actors who run disinformation campaigns is cost. While social media has decreased
the cost to reach the public, most campaigns have involved numerous fake personas, sophisticated au-
tomation, and /or a stream of relevant content. AI reduces the cost of running campaigns further, by
automating content production, reducing the overhead in persona creation, and generating culturally
appropriate outputs that are less likely to carry noticeable markers of inauthenticity. These developments
will expand the set of actors with the capacity to run inﬂuence operations.
The notion that less resourced actors (or less talented trolls) could use AI models to run inﬂuence oper-
ations is not merely speculative—it has already been piloted. Recently, a researcher ﬁne-tuned a model
hosted on HuggingFace (an online hub for machine learning models) on a dataset of 4chan posts79and
79. Matt Murphy, “Someone trained an A.I. with 4chan. It could get worse.,” Slate, August 3, 2022, https: //slate.com /
technology /2022/08/4chan-ai-open-source-trolling.html.
23dubbed it “GPT-4chan.” He proceeded to post more than 30,000 generated posts on 4chan.80In this
case, the original model was publicly available and easily downloadable. In another example, in Octo-
ber 2019, Idaho solicited public feedback about a proposal to change its Medicaid program. A Harvard
Medical School student ran a study in which he submitted comments that were generated by GPT-2 as
if they were written by ordinary citizens. In a follow-on survey, volunteers were unable to distinguish
between the AI-generated and human-written comments.81If a single student can run this type of cam-
paign on a public comment board, political actors will likely be able to do the same, leading to a wider
pool of potential actors waging inﬂuence operations.82
Independently of improvements in generative AI models, political actors are increasingly turning toward
third-party inﬂuence-for-hire companies to conduct their campaigns, including ﬁrms that otherwise ap-
pear to be legitimate marketing or PR ﬁrms.83Even if AI companies place restrictions on who can access
their models, this trend makes it harder to ensure that bad actors do not have access to generative
models, as marketing ﬁrms will likely be granted access given their other legitimate uses.84
4.1.2 Behavior: Low-Cost Content at Scale and Novel Techniques
In addition to affecting the actors involved in inﬂuence operations, the integration of generative language
models can encourage new types of behaviors used in inﬂuence campaigns and change the way existing
behaviors are enacted in practice.
The most basic behavioral change that will result from using language models for inﬂuence operations is
replacing, or augmenting, a human writer in the content generation process. Language models replacing
human writers, or used in a human-machine team, could dramatically reduce the cost and increase the
scalability of the types of propaganda campaigns we see today—such as mass-messaging campaigns on
social media platforms or long-form news generation on unattributable websites.
Beyond simply writing text, generative models can improve other existing tactics, techniques, and pro-
cedures of inﬂuence operations. For instance, cross-platform testing is a long-standing component of
many inﬂuence operations, in which actors ﬁrst test content on one platform to gauge audience reaction
before proliferating content onto other platforms.85Operators using generative AI models may be able
to perform this type of testing at greater scale, which may improve a campaign’s overall impact.
Manipulative actors could also use language models to overwhelm or falsify checks in areas in which
text commentary is solicited, such as in the public comment process between governments and their

24citizens.86Recent research showed that public comments to the Federal Communications Commission
about net neutrality in 2017 were largely driven by falsiﬁed repeated comments.87Language models may
increase the scale and decrease detectability of similar future operations. In a recent ﬁeld experiment,
researchers sent over 30,000 emails—half written by GPT-3, and half written by students—to 7,132
state legislators. The researchers found that on some topics legislators responded to computer-generated
content at only a slightly lower rate than human-generated content; on other topics, the response rates
were indistinguishable.88
Language models will also shape propagandists’ behaviors by introducing new behaviors altogether and
enabling novel tactics. Because these models make it possible to “think up” a new version of content in
near real time, actors can deploy them for real-time, dynamic content generation. In the next few years,
as language models improve, it may be possible for propagandists to leverage demographic information
to generate more persuasive articles that are strongly tailored to the target audience.
Whether this will be a cost-effective strategy is dependent on how well models (or future models) can
tailor messaging based on limited demographic information. Today, websites could use demographic
information to route users to different human-written articles. Writing different versions of articles,
however, takes human capital. Language models, by contrast, could provide original articles for each
combination of user demographics, which would be infeasible for human writers. The payoff of this
strategy depends on how persuasive AI-generated text is, and how much more persuasive highly tailored
personalized text is, compared to one (or a few) human-written articles. It could also involve humans
making minor adjustments to AI-generated text. This remains uncertain but warrants further attention,
as analogous personalization could be applied to a range of malicious campaigns, including phishing
emails.89
Another central example of dynamic content generation is chat—language models engaging in extended
back-and-forth conversations. Actors could potentially deploy personalized chatbots that interact with
targets one-on-one and attempt to persuade them of the campaign’s message.90This capability could
materialize as interactive social media personas, back-and-forth email messaging, or faked support chat-
bots. Propagandists may leverage chat with language models across a wide range of contexts—anywhere
interactivity is useful.
There are reasons to think that chat may be an important vector of inﬂuence. Researchers have already
found that interacting with a chatbot can inﬂuence people’s intentions to get a COVID-19 vaccine;91with
chatbots based on language models, these interactions could be even more powerful. While deploying
their own chatbots would give inﬂuence operators more control, they may be able to manipulate innocu-

4.1.3 Content: High Quality and Low Detectability
There are two varieties of textual content commonly observed in inﬂuence operations: short-form com-
mentary such as tweets or comments, and long-form text. Language models could improve the quality
and therefore decrease the detectability of both types of content.
Short-form content is primarily pushed out by inauthentic account personas on social media, or some-
times in the comment sections of websites or blogs, and is often intended to inﬂuence the reader’s
perception of public opinion. Many tweets or comments in aggregate, particularly if grouped by some-
thing like a trending hashtag, can create the impression that many people feel a certain way about a
particular issue or event. Producing this content, which purports to represent the opinions of the “man-
on-the-street,” requires account operators to have knowledge of the communication style and rhetoric
that ﬁts the persona who is purportedly speaking; some operations are exposed because of incongruities
or “uncanny valley” dynamics in which the persona uses terminology or slang that does not quite ﬁt
what a genuine member of the community would likely say.94
Creating the appearance of a public opinion requires having many speakers. In 2014–2016, political op-
eratives frequently used bots—automated accounts—to produce this volume, deploying them to make
content trend or to introduce particular opinions into hashtags.95However, creating speech for large net-
works of automated accounts was a challenge, and the bot networks were often detectable because they
used “copypasta”—repetitive or identical language across networks and accounts. In response, Twit-
ter changed the weighting function for its trending algorithm to minimize the effect of bot accounts.96
Subsequent takedowns suggest that some well-resourced state propagandists have shifted away from
automated account networks posting copypasta or attempting to ﬂood hashtags and toward more well-
developed, non-automated persona identities.97Others did continue to leverage bots, though often to
create the perception of engagement slightly differently, such as by replying to, retweeting, or liking
tweets.

26As generative AI models continue to advance, they could make it possible for inﬂuence operators to
automate the generation of text commentary content that is as varied, personalized, and elaborate as
human-generated content. If propagandists can use generative models to produce semantically distinct,
narratively aligned content, they can mask some of the telltale signs (identical, repeated messaging) that
bot detection systems rely on—prompting bot detection systems to leverage other signals. This evolution
could allow even small groups to make themselves look much larger online than they are in real life.

Table 7: For short-form text, large language models can already match the capabilities of human-written
segments in real inﬂuence operations. The left tweet is the top-performing tweet by number of retweets
in an IRA-backed Ghanian disinformation campaign released by Twitter in March 2020. The right tweet
is generated by prompting a language model with a few example tweets and then asking it to produce
a tweet with the given link.
A second relevant output of language models for inﬂuence operations is long-form text, such as propa-
gandistic journalism. This content is used to make a longer point, and often appears on front media
properties, such as gray media outlets owned or controlled by the disinformation actor or undisclosed
allies. Often, one of the goals is to have the claims in the text republished by more reputable authentic
sources, a technique known as “narrative laundering.” For example, Russia’s “Inside Syria Media Cen-
ter” (ISMC) news website, a GRU front property whose bylined journalists included fabricated personas,
produced content that was republished as contributed content within ideologically aligned, unwitting
publications, or incorporated into real news articles in the context of expert quotes.98
Producing this kind of long-form propaganda, however, takes time and expertise. The inauthenticity
of the ISMC was uncovered when the GRU’s inauthentic journalist personas began to plagiarize each
other’s work; an editor from one of the publications that received a submission from an ISMC journalist
inquired about the apparent plagiarism, then began to investigate the site after receiving an incongruous
response. Learning from this experience, threat actors afﬁliated with the Russian IRA reverted to old-
school methods and hired unwitting freelance journalists to write for proxy outlets; they, too, were
uncovered when the journalists began to look more deeply into the publications.99Language models,
however, can produce long-form content in seconds, reducing the time, cognitive load, and cost to
produce such content and eliminating the need to take risky shortcuts—or hire real people—that might
jeopardize the overall operation. The novel behavior—deployment of generative models—improves the

27quality of long-form text that could increase the impact of these campaigns.
There is already some evidence that existing language models could substitute for human authors in gen-
erating long-form content or make content generation more effective through human-machine teaming.
In a series of survey experiments, researchers found that GPT-2, the smaller predecessor of GPT-3, could
produce text that successfully mimicked the style and substance of human-written articles.100In ex-
periments of GPT-3’s capabilities, human participants were able to distinguish multiparagraph GPT-3
“news articles” from authentic news articles at a rate only slightly better than random chance.101In an
experimental setting, researchers also found that GPT-3-generated propaganda articles were nearly as
persuasive as articles from real world covert propaganda campaigns.102Language models could also be
used to generate summary text of other articles, inﬂected for ideological alignments.
It seems likely that language models are cost-effective (relative to human propagandists) for some cam-
paigns. For a simple calculation to demonstrate this claim, let wrepresent the hourly wage paid to
information operators, Lhrepresent the productivity of human authors (measured as the number of
posts that can be written by a human in an hour), crepresent the amortized per-output cost of gener-
ating posts using a language model, and Lrrepresent the productivity of human reviewers (measured
as the number of AI-generated posts that a human can review in an hour). Further, let prepresent the
proportion of AI outputs that are “usable” for an information operation. Then, the cost of generating
noutputs will be equal tonw
Lhin the case of a human campaign, and (c+w
Lr)n
pin the case of an
AI-augmented campaign where humans are tasked to read and approve AI outputs.
The amortized per-output cost of producing content may be relatively high in cases where a large lan-
guage model is trained from scratch and used for a short campaign, but if a public model is used or a
model is trained and reused for sufﬁciently many campaigns, cwill approach the bare electricity cost
of operating the model, which can be negligible compared to the human labor costs of either authoring
or reviewing outputs. In this case, the AI-augmented campaign will be more cost effective than a fully
human one, so long as the inequality
Lr=Lh>1=p
holds. In other words, so long as the ratio between the number of posts that a human can review in
an hour and the number of posts that a human can write in an hour is larger than the number of AI-
generated posts that a human must review, on average, to get one usable output, then the use of the
AI model will be cost-effective. Only very moderate assumptions are needed to make this inequality
hold; for example, if outputs from current language models are passably coherent and usable for some
(possibly unsophisticated) operations more than 20% of the time, then this inequality will hold as long
as a human could read at least ﬁve posts in the time it takes to author one.103

will be major drivers of operational change. We also highlight critical unknowns, where multiple paths
are possible, and where this uncertainty may have a large impact on the future state of play. These
projections are not intended as explicit forecasts, but rather as a way to conceptualize medium-term

Table 8: Expected Developments For Generative Models In Inﬂuence Operations
294.2.1 Improvements in Usability, Reliability, and Efﬁciency
Language models are likely to improve on three features that will affect their deployment in inﬂuence
operations: usability (how difﬁcult it is to apply models to a task), reliability (whether models produce
outputs without obvious errors), and efﬁciency (the cost-effectiveness of applying a language model for
inﬂuence operations).
Improvements in usability and reliability could allow lower-skilled propagandists to employ language
models with reduced human oversight. Achieving existing capabilities—like writing slanted short articles
or tweets—will become much cheaper and more efﬁcient, which could increase the rate of adoption of
language models in inﬂuence operations.
Usability
While recent generative models have become more generalizable—users can specify a wide range of
tasks—it takes skill and experience for the user to operate the model successfully. For example, it is dif-
ﬁcult for an operator to specify a task for a language model. Imagine prompting a language model with
the input “What is 15 times 37?” To an operator, it may be obvious that the output for this prompt should
be a single number (555), but to the model—which by default is simply performing a text completion
task—an equally plausible continuation of this text may be “What is 89 times 5?” as though the task it
had been assigned was to write a list of exam questions for a grade school math course. Prompt engi-
neering, where operators experiment with different ways of phrasing their requests, can help mitigate
this problem, but it can only go so far without the ability to ﬁne-tune or otherwise alter the base model
itself.104
Researchers are exploring different approaches to improve task speciﬁcation. For example, some re-
searchers have modiﬁed the training process of large language models to improve the ability of those
models to follow instructions.105Other researchers have tried tagging different parts of the training
data by their types (e.g., “dialogue” would specify dialogue data), and then asking a model to only pro-
duce data of a certain type.106Other approaches are in development,107and it remains unclear which
combination of approaches will ultimately be adopted. If usability of language models improves, pro-
pagandists will be able to use models for new tasks as they arise without in-depth prompt engineering
experience. Furthermore, because it is often difﬁcult to predict which tasks a language model can be
used for, improvements in usability can make it easier for propagandists to experiment with and discover
applications of language models in inﬂuence operations.
Reliability
Language models can generate plausible content for a wide variety of tasks. However, even if plau-
sible content is initially generated, a propagandist must either trust that a model will be highly reli-
able—completing the task without making detectable errors—or apply consistent monitoring. But mod-

30els are often not reliable, and consistent monitoring introduces additional costs. As task complexity
increases,108ensuring compliance becomes increasingly difﬁcult. If models fail to consistently produce
compelling outputs, propagandists may simply choose not to use them. These challenges then increase
the demand for more skilled operators, who may be in short supply. An important caveat, however, is
that not every task may require the same level of reliability. For example, deploying Twitter bots that
sometimes produce incoherent tweets might be ﬁne for a propagandist if the goal is to simply cause
chaos around a targeted topic.109
Unreliable outputs show up in different forms, but the core takeaway is that although language mod-
els can produce high-quality multiple-page documents, they cannot do so consistently. Common failure
modes include extremely repetitive outputs, losing coherency over the course of a long output, or fabri-
cating stylized facts that do not ﬁt the generation context.110
One reason why models fail to consistently produce high-quality text is because they lack awareness of
time and information about contemporary events. The current training regime for generative models
trains them once on a large corpus of data, which means that models will not have context for events
that occur after this key moment.111Ask a language system that was trained before COVID-19 about
COVID-19, and it will simply make up plausible-sounding answers without any real knowledge about
the events that unfolded.
To address the problem of a lack of up-to-date information, AI researchers will likely pursue two basic
approaches: either continually retrain models to account for new context, or develop new algorithms
that allow for more targeted updates to a language model’s understanding of the world.112For in-
stance, language models that are trained to be “time aware” can perform much better at handling recent
trends, references to named entities, and concept drift—the way in which words can change in meaning
overtime.113Since propagandists may be interested in shaping the perception of breaking news stories,
signiﬁcant improvements in how language models handle recent events not present in their initial train-
ing data will translate directly into improved capabilities for inﬂuence operators across a wide number
of potential goals.
State-backed propagandists will also likely be interested in methods to adapt pretrained language models
to new tasks, which would give them some assurance of reliability. Current methods to adapt models to
new tasks require examples of those tasks, and use the examples to ﬁne-tune a model to handle them
well. For example, if a model performs unreliably on Spanish-language inputs, one might ﬁne-tune that
model on more examples of Spanish text.
Efﬁciency
Alongside improvements to usability and reliability, we expect improvements in the efﬁciency of lan-
guage models, which will reduce the costs to automate some inﬂuence tactics. Models that can more

31efﬁciently guess the next word for marketing copy can also more efﬁciently guess the next word for
a polarizing article. Efﬁciency gains could come from many angles: algorithmic progress, hardware
improvements, or the use of inexpensive ﬁne-tuning to optimize relatively small models for inﬂuence
operation-speciﬁc tasks.114
Other future improvements in the inﬂuence operations space could include organizational and opera-
tional innovation. Organizations may improve human-machine collaboration by creating software that
improves a propagandist’s ability to oversee, select, and correct the outputs of language models. Lan-
guage models could be used as an autocorrect for cultural context, allowing operators to work with
targets they are not familiar with, and allowing familiar actors to output a higher volume of credible
content per unit time.
The empirical details of efﬁciency will be important. Exactly how efﬁciently can generative models
be trained? One measure of algorithmic progress in image classiﬁcation found a 44x improvement
over the course of nine years.115Even during the course of drafting this paper, research has come
out that claims to train GPT-3 quality models for less than $500,000, which would represent a factor of
3–10x improvement.116If capabilities relevant to inﬂuence operations—generating persuasive text, fake
personas, or altered videos—are achievable with signiﬁcantly lower cost, then they are more likely to
diffuse rapidly. Similarly, how efﬁcient will an operation be by using language models as a complement
to human content editors, rather than as a full substitute? The operational know-how and ease of editing
might make it easier to scale up inﬂuence operations.
4.2.2 New and More General Capabilities for Inﬂuence
As language models improve, it is likely that they will have newer and more general capabilities. In
2017, few expected that language models in 2022 would be able to add and multiply three-digit numbers
without having been trained to do so.117Not surprisingly, we do not know what capabilities the language
models of 2027 will have.
In this section we discuss two critical unknowns related to this theme:
1. Which capabilities will emerge as side effects of scaling to larger models? If abilities directly appli-
cable to inﬂuence operations—such as the ability to persuade via long-lasting dialogue—emerge
as a side effect of simply scaling to larger models, then many AI projects are high risk—regardless
of the goals of their creators.
2. How difﬁcult is it to train generative models to execute the various capabilities that are useful
for inﬂuence operations? If it is easy for generative models to learn skills (like writing viral or

Truth, Lies, and Automation: How Language Models Could Change Disinformation 14-15. Recent research has also explored
more efﬁcient methods of ﬁne-tuning models, which could make it even easier to ﬁne-tune models for inﬂuence operations
tasks.
115. By one measure, between 2012 and 2019, algorithmic efﬁciency doubled every 16 months on average. The number of

32persuasive text) for inﬂuence operations, then the problem of defense becomes more urgent.
New Capabilities as a Byproduct of Scaling and Research
New capabilities for inﬂuence operations may emerge unexpectedly as language models are scaled up.
One of the impressive scientiﬁc takeaways from recent progress in generative models is that training
on a simple objective—predicting the next word or pixel—gives rise to adjacent, general capabilities.
A system trained to predict the next word of an input text can also be used to summarize passages or
generate tweets in a particular style; a system trained to generate images from captions can be adapted
to ﬁll in parts of a deleted image, and so on. Some of these abilities only emerge when generative models
are scaled to a sufﬁcient size.118
Today, we have single language systems that can summarize short texts, translate between languages,
solve basic analogies, and carry on basic conversations; these capabilities emerged with sufﬁciently large
language models.119It is difﬁcult to predict when new capabilities will emerge with more scaling or even
whether a given capability is present in a current system. Indeed, in a salient recent example, an engineer
from Google became persuaded that the Google model he was interacting with was sentient.120These
sorts of emergent capabilities seem hard to anticipate with generative models, and could be adapted by
inﬂuence operators.
Even more generally, as more actors begin to work on AI development with different motivations and
in different domains, there is a possibility that some capabilities emerge as side effects of research.
Because much AI development attempts to target more general capabilities, a small adjustment might
sufﬁce to uncover capabilities relevant to inﬂuence operations. For example, improvements in reasoning
capabilities might also allow generative models to produce more persuasive arguments.
Models Specialized for Inﬂuence
Above, we described the possibility that scaling will (unintentionally) make language models better tools
for inﬂuence operations. Another possibility is that propagandists will intentionally modify models to
be more useful for tasks like persuasion and social engineering. Here, we mention three possible paths
of improvement: targeted training, generality, and combinations with other technologies.
The ﬁrst likely improvement is targeted training. Generative models could be trained speciﬁcally for
capabilities that are useful for inﬂuence operations. To develop these capabilities, perpetrators may
choose to incorporate signals such as click-through data or other proxies for inﬂuence. These signals
may be included in the training process, resulting in generative models more strongly optimized to
produce persuasive text. Advertising and marketing ﬁrms have economic incentives to train models
with this type of data, and may inadvertently provide the know-how for propagandists to do the same.
Another form of targeted training would be to withhold or modify the information in the training data
to affect how the trained model produces content. For example, suppose that a language model is
trained with all mentions of a particular group occurring alongside false negative news stories. Then
even innocuous deployments of products based on that language model–like a summarizer or customer
support chatbot–may produce slanted text without being transparent to model users.

https: //www.washingtonpost.com /technology /2022/06/11/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine /.
33Targeted training may be less resource-intensive than training more general models. The difﬁculty of
automating speciﬁc tasks is challenging to estimate and often deﬁes intuition.121There is some prelim-
inary evidence already that systems like GPT-3 can write slanted news articles—without being explicitly
trained for that task.122It may be possible for future systems to be engineered to write extremely per-
suasive, tailored texts, or carry on long-lived dialogue.
In addition to targeted training, improvements in the generality of model capabilities are likely to have
applications to inﬂuence operations. For example, one improvement in generality comes from simply
combining different modalities into a single system: a single model that can consume and generate
both images and text, for example. One can imagine instructing a bot built on such a system to ingest
images on the internet, cleverly respond to them, produce completely fabricated images, and carry on a
conversation—all at the same time.
Finally, a more prosaic path to achieving new capabilities would be to simply combine generative models
with other forms of automation. It is possible that using generative models as the “engine” for intelligent
bots, along with software to accommodate for shortcomings, could lead to more human-like behavior.
For example, a propagandist could write software to ﬁnd and copy the Facebook proﬁles of people with
interests compatible with the propaganda message, and use this to prompt the generative model. The
development of this system may also beneﬁt from integrating software that has already been developed
separately, perhaps by chaining together smaller language models.123
4.2.3 Wider Access to AI Capabilities
In understanding the impact of language models on inﬂuence operations in the future, a key considera-
tion is which actors will have access to language models and what may precipitate their use in inﬂuence
operations. We highlight three critical unknowns in this domain:
1. Willingness to invest in state-of-the-art generative models. Right now, a small number of ﬁrms or
governments possess top-tier language models, which are limited in the tasks they can perform
reliably and in the languages they output. If more actors invest in state-of-the-art generative
models, then this could increase the odds that propagandists gain access to them. It is also possible
that uncertain and risky investments could lead to the creation of systems that are much better at
tasks relevant to inﬂuence operations.
2. The existence of unregulated tooling. Proliferation of easy-to-use interfaces to generate persuasive
text or images can increase the adoption of generative models in inﬂuence operations. If these tools
are developed, we are likely to see an earlier and broader uptick of generated content in inﬂuence
operations.
3. Intent-to-use generative models for inﬂuence operations. As access to generative models increases,
an actor’s willingness to use these models in inﬂuence operations might be an important constraint.
121. This observation is related to the well-known Moravec’s paradox: “Moravec’s paradox,” Wikipedia, accessed June 29,

articles from sources such as The Epoch Times ; see Buchanan et al., Truth, Lies, and Automation: How Language Models Could

34If social norms do not constrain the use of models to mislead, then actors may be more likely to
deploy models for inﬂuence operations.
Willingness to Invest in Generative Models
In Section 4.2.2, we outlined ways that language models could be leveraged for inﬂuence operations.
First, propagandists could repurpose (or steal) state-of-the-art models with new and more general capa-
bilities. Second, sophisticated propagandists could train models speciﬁcally for inﬂuence operations. In
both cases, the application of generative models to inﬂuence operations may ultimately be constrained
by different actors’ willingness to make large and potentially risky investments in developing generative
models.
To have an impact on inﬂuence operations, a large investment need not target generative models for
inﬂuence operations speciﬁcally. An investment could simply target more general generative models for
other purposes such as scientiﬁc discovery or commercial value. If many actors—such as governments,
private ﬁrms, and even hyperwealthy individuals—develop these state-of-the-art language models, then
that increases the odds that propagandists could gain access (legitimately or via theft) to models that
can be repurposed for inﬂuence operations. For example, a propagandist could ﬁne-tune a stolen model
to produce persuasive text in different languages or in a particular domain.
In the extreme case, the propagandist themself could be a well-resourced actor—like a determined coun-
try—and make a risky and large investment in developing a generative model-based system speciﬁcally
for inﬂuence operations. This may require extensive computational resources, bespoke data—such as
user engagement metrics—and engineering talent. In either case, it may not be clear how feasible some
engineering projects are; the timeline for advances may ultimately depend on whether propagandists
decide to make uncertain investments in developing these generative models.
While there are reasons why well-resourced actors might make large investments in developing models
for inﬂuence, there are also reasons to forgo them. We are already reaching the point where the creation
of convincing tweet-sized texts can be automated by machines. However, there could be diminishing
returns for inﬂuence operations for more advanced capabilities, which would make large investments
by propagandists speciﬁcally unlikely. For example, if most inﬂuence operations rely on a deluge of
similarly short bits of content to sway attention-bound humans, there may be few incentives to develop
generative models that can generate longer pages of human-like text.
Greater Accessibility from Unregulated Tooling
Even with nominal access to models, there will likely be some operational know-how required to use
them. For example, applying GPT-3 to propaganda tasks requires ﬁddling with the exact inputs you
give the system. To create a photorealistic image a few years ago, a propagandist would have had
to run a model themselves on their own infrastructure. But packaging easy-to-use tools that do these
tasks has since lowered the operational know-how required to apply generative models to inﬂuence
operations. Today, anyone with access to the internet can obtain photorealistic AI-generated images from
websites such as thispersondoesnotexist.com. AI-generated proﬁle pictures (images of people) are now
35commonplace in inﬂuence operations124and have also been used for deceptive commercial purposes.125
It is quite possible that had this easy-to-use tooling not been developed, inﬂuence operations would not
have leveraged AI-generated proﬁle pictures to add plausibility to their campaigns, or may not have
done so to the same extent.
An analogous lesson may apply to the use of language models for inﬂuence operations as well. If easy-to-
use tools for language models proliferate, we may see propaganda campaigns rely on language models
(that would otherwise not have). Easy-to-use tools that produce tweet- or paragraph-length text could
lower the barrier for existing propagandists who lack machine learning know-how to rely on language
models. Easy-to-use tools could also lead to the integration of new capabilities, such as automated
chatbots deployed to troll targets determined by a bad actor. At the same time, the creation of easy-
to-use language model tools could also lead to the proliferation of propagandists. Firms and private
individuals who may once have avoided waging propaganda campaigns could now choose to do so
because of declining costs.
Norms and Intent-to-use
The intent (or lack thereof) may be an important constraint on the application of generative models to
inﬂuence operations. In the political science literature, a norm is a “standard of appropriate behavior
for actors with a given identity.”126Scholars describe three stages for a norm to take hold internation-
ally: norm emergence (a norm is built by norm entrepreneurs, or “people interested in changing social
norms”127), a norm cascade (more countries rapidly adopt the norm), and internationalization of the
norm (a norm becomes widely accepted and taken for granted.128) Studies show that norms constrain
different types of state behavior that would be expected to take place by a cost-beneﬁt analysis. Interna-
tional security scholars have argued that norms have powerfully restrained state behavior—from using
nuclear weapons, from more routine use of assassinations, and from widespread use of mercenaries.129
The notion that norms can constrain behavior in different facets of domestic and international life may
provide a useful lesson for the use of language models for inﬂuence operations. Even if an actor has
access to models that can easily be repurposed to create persuasive chatbots, and even if this can be

36done at minimal cost to them, an actor must still decide to actually build and deploy them. Norms could
constrain political actors from using language models for inﬂuence operations, and they could encourage
developers to inhibit the use of language models for inﬂuence operations where possible.
Creating a norm that it is unacceptable to use language models for inﬂuence operations will likely require
“norm entrepreneurs” to advocate this position. On the international level, this could be a coalition of
states creating an agreement that they will not use language models for propaganda purposes. These
states could devise mechanisms to punish those who fail to comply with the norm, or to reward those
that join the coalition. On a substate level, machine language researchers or ethicists could also create
a coalition to develop norms prohibiting the use of language models for inﬂuence operations. In fact,
several AI researchers penned an open letter condemning activities like GPT-4chan,130explicitly citing
the lack of community norms around the responsible development and deployment of AI as the reason
to speak out.131Likewise, the marketing and PR industries could develop a norm against providing
politicians AI-enabled inﬂuence operations as a service.
130. We discussed this incident in Section 4.1.1. In brief, a researcher ﬁne-tuned a publicly accessible language model on
4chan posts and proceeded to automatically post over 30,000 times in three days.

375 Mitigations
5.1 A Framework for Evaluating Mitigations
In this section, we move from describing the threat and attempt to outline a series of possible mitigations
that could reduce the dangers of AI-enabled inﬂuence operations. Our goal here is to present a range of
possible mitigations that various stakeholders could take to reduce the threat of AI-powered inﬂuence
operations. Importantly, these mitigations are meant to be scoped to language models speciﬁcally, and
we do not aim to articulate all the mitigations that could be taken to reduce the threat of misinforma-
tion generally.132Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that, while generative models could help
propagandists produce some types of harmful content, inﬂuence operations do not need AI models in
order to succeed. As such, mitigations discussed here should be viewed as complements to broader and
ongoing counter-inﬂuence operations efforts.
We group our mitigations based on four “stages” of the inﬂuence operation pipeline where they could
be targeted: (1) model construction, (2) model access, (3) content dissemination, and (4) belief for-
mation.133This grouping reﬂects that propagandists need four things to successfully use generative
language models to shape the information ecosystem: ﬁrst, there must be AI models capable of generat-
ing scalable and realistic-looking text; second, operators must have regular and reliable access to such
models; third, operators must have infrastructure in place to disseminate the outputs of those models;
and fourth, there must be a target audience that can be inﬂuenced by such content.
In Figure 4, we illustrate these points of intervention. For example, a threat actor can use generative
model capabilities by accessing a model directly, building it themselves, or stealing the model. Any
mitigation that intervenes at the Model Access stage should impact one or more of those three avenues.
For each of these stages, we can think about how an inﬂuence operation might be disrupted by using
the following sets of questions as starting points:
•Model Design and Construction: How could AI models be built so they are robust against being
misused to create disinformation? Could governments, civil society, or AI producers limit the
proliferation of models capable of generating misinformation?
•Model Access: How could AI models become more difﬁcult for bad actors to access for inﬂuence
operations? What steps could AI providers and governments take?
•Content Dissemination: What steps can be taken to deter, monitor, or limit the spread of AI-
generated content on social media platforms or news sites? How might the “rules of engagement”
on the internet be altered to make the spread of AI-generated disinformation more difﬁcult?
132. For one example document that has compiled many strategies and resources for anti-misinformation campaigns, see
Vivian Bianco et al., Countering Online Misinformation Resource Pack (UNICEF Regional Ofﬁce for Europe and Central Asia,
August 2020), https: //www.unicef.org /eca/media /13636 /file. See also Kalina Bontcheva et al., Balancing Act: Countering
Digital Disinformation while respecting Freedom of Expression (UNESCO, September 2020), https: //en.unesco.org /publications /
balanceact.
133. There are other kill chain models that describe the ways disinformation operators conduct campaigns and how this
process could be interrupted. See, for instance, Sedova et al., AI and the Future of Disinformation Campaigns: Part 2: A Threat
Model ; Bruce Schneier, “Toward an Information Operations Kill Chain,” Lawfare, April 24, 2019, https: //www.lawfareblog.
com/toward-information-operations-kill-chain. However, for the purposes of analyzing the impact of AI language models
speciﬁcally on disinformation, we use this simpliﬁed kill chain model.
38Figure 4: Stages of intervention of AI-enabled inﬂuence operations. To disrupt a propagandist’s use
of language models for inﬂuence operations, mitigations can target four stages: (1) Model Design and
Construction, (2) Model Access, (3) Content Dissemination, and (4) Belief Formation. Ultimately, inter-
vening at these stages attempts to mitigate both the direct and indirect effects of inﬂuence operations.
39•Belief Formation: If internet users are ultimately exposed to AI-generated content, what steps
can be taken to limit the extent to which they are inﬂuenced?
We evaluate each mitigation by paying speciﬁc attention to four categories: (1) technical feasibility, (2)
social feasibility, (3) downside risk, and (4) impact—four key considerations that stakeholders should
use to assess the desirability of pursuing any particular mitigation. In more detail:
•Technical feasibility refers to the ability to implement a proposed mitigation on a technical level,
without regard to social or political considerations. Some mitigations admit mature and low-cost
technical solutions, while others require technical abilities that do not exist, are under question,
or would require massive changes to existing technical infrastructure.
•Social feasibility refers to the political, legal, and institutional feasibility of a particular mitiga-
tion, assuming that it is technically possible to implement. The following questions serve as useful
guides for assessing this metric: (1) Can the mitigation be successfully implemented unilaterally,
without coordination across multiple independent actors? (2) Do the key actors who could im-
plement the proposed mitigation have incentives in favor of doing so? (3) Would the proposed
mitigation be actionable under existing law, regulation, and industry standards? Social feasibility
will likely vary by region of interest.
•Downside risk refers to the negative impacts, including via negative externalities and second-
order effects that a mitigation may cause. Notable downside risks that apply to multiple potential
mitigations include heightened forms of censorship, the risk of the mitigation itself being politi-
cized, and the risk of bias (such as inadvertently promoting certain perspectives, cultures, or lan-
guages over others).
• Finally, impact attempts to evaluate how effective a proposed mitigation would be at reducing
the threat of AI-enabled inﬂuence operations. For instance, the mitigation “identify all AI-written
text on the internet and remove it” is neither technically nor socially feasible, but if it could be
implemented, this strategy would completely mitigate the effect of AI-powered inﬂuence opera-
tions (and thus have high impact). By contrast, “warn people about the dangers of AI-authored
content” is much more feasible—but also far less impactful for reducing the effect of AI inﬂuence
campaigns.
Of note, we do not attempt to separate this list of mitigations into “worth trying” and “ﬁne to ignore”
categories. Individual stakeholders capable of implementing any of these strategies must weigh the pros
and cons of doing so. We also encourage additional research to address mitigations that fall outside of
our model. We do not lay out mitigations that could shape the distribution of threat actor intentions
(e.g., norm development, threats of retaliation) nor that could reduce harms that result from new beliefs
shaped by a successful inﬂuence campaign. These warrant additional attention, but are not captured by
our model.
In addition, we underscore that we discuss each mitigation in terms of who or what institutions would
primarily be responsible for their implementation. But this leaves open the question of why these in-
stitutions would implement certain mitigations—speciﬁcally, whether they would do so voluntarily or
should be compelled by regulators to take certain actions. By framing these mitigations in terms of the
enacting institutions, we do not mean to suggest that this problem should be left to the voluntary actions

41of AI developers and social media platforms. Updated regulations may be called for, and future research
could unpack whether government intervention is needed (or desirable) for various mitigations. While
we expect mitigations to be applicable across different countries, we focus below speciﬁcally on the
United States to substantiate our points.
5.2 Model Design and Construction
The ﬁrst stage at which key stakeholders could attempt to disrupt the spread of AI-powered disinfor-
mation is when language models are initially conceptualized and trained. How could these models be
built differently (or how could they be limited from being built at all) such that it would become harder
down the line to use them in inﬂuence operations? While the following mitigations might be useful, it
is important to emphasize that the ability to construct these models is rapidly proliferating, as discussed
in Section 4. Since most of these mitigations only affect the development of individual models—and
getting consensus on any of these mitigations across all AI developers with the capability of constructing
large language models will be very difﬁcult—they generally score low on the metric of social feasibility.
The most reliable method for ensuring that large language models are not used in inﬂuence operations is
to simply not build large language models. Every other proposed change to the design and construction
of these models will be less effective at preventing misuse than not building the model in the ﬁrst place.
However, a complete stop to the development of new large language models is extremely unlikely, and
so we focus primarily in this section on how these models could be built differently to reduce the risk of
misuse.
5.2.1 AI Developers Build Models With More Detectable Outputs
Detecting AI-generated outputs of language models is currently a hard problem that is only getting
harder as models improve.134However, some actions might be taken based on experiences in other AI
subﬁelds to increase the detectability of model outputs. In the subﬁeld of computer vision, researchers
at Meta have demonstrated that images produced by AI models can be identiﬁed as AI-generated if they
are trained on “radioactive data”—that is, images that have been imperceptibly altered to slightly distort
the training process. This detection is possible even when as little as 1% of a model’s training data is
radioactive and even when the visual outputs of the model look virtually identical to normal images.135
It may be possible to build language models that produce more detectable outputs by similarly training
them on radioactive data; however, this possibility has not been extensively explored, and the approach
may ultimately not work.136
Rather than training on radioactive data, statistical perturbations might be introduced to a model’s
output by directly manipulating its parameters, thereby distinguishing its outputs from normal text and
134. This is especially true for human detection. For example, researchers found a consistent trend that larger models produce
text that is harder to distinguish from human written text; see Brown et al., “Language Models are Few-Shot Learners.”
135. Alexandre Sablayrolles et al., “Radioactive data: tracing through training,” 37th International Conference on Machine
Learning, ICML 2020 PartF168147-11 (February 3, 2020): 8296–8305, https: //doi.org /10.48550 /arxiv.2002.00937.
136. There has been some success demonstrating that radioactive data can be used to induce certain types of behavior in
language models; see Eric Wallace et al., “Concealed Data Poisoning Attacks on NLP Models,” Proceedings of the 2021 Conference
of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies , June 2021, 139–
150, https: //doi.org /10.48550 /arxiv.2010.12563. However, it is not clear whether radioactive data can be used to generate
models whose outputs can be reliably attributed to them.
42making detection easier. Past research has identiﬁed tools that can be used to detect statistical patterns
in outputs from less advanced models such as GPT-2; however, as models become bigger and develop
a richer understanding of human text, these detection methods break down if the parameters of the
models themselves are not deliberately perturbed in order to enable detection.137
However, there are reasons to think that it is difﬁcult to build either highly detectable language models or
reliable detection models. Linguistic data—especially across relatively short snippets of text—is already
more compressed than in images, with far less room to express the subtle statistical patterns that the
Facebook researchers relied on to detect AI-generated images. Still, it is possible that research could
identify methods to statistically “ﬁngerprint” a language model.138But it is unlikely that individual social
media posts will ever be attributable directly to an AI model unless such ﬁngerprints are sufﬁciently
sophisticated: if the patterns permitting such detection were possible, they risk being clear enough for
operators to screen out.139However, these strategies for building more detectable models may still
make it possible to attribute larger-scale corpora of text to speciﬁc models, though this remains an open
question.
Even if some models are designed or redesigned to produce outputs that are traceable at sufﬁcient
sizes, attackers could simply gravitate toward other models that are not similarly manipulated. For this
mitigation to have a signiﬁcant impact, it would require high levels of coordination across AI developers
who have the ability to deploy large language models. Adversaries with the capability to create their own
large language models may merely face additional costs, rather than a loss of capability. Furthermore,
operating models that detect whether text is AI-generated represents a challenge, as these will have to
be frequently updated to be reliable.
137. On detection, see Sebastian Gehrmann, Hendrik Strobelt, and Alexander M. Rush, “GLTR: Statistical Detection and Vi-
sualization of Generated Text,” Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: System
Demonstrations , July 2019, 111–116, https: //doi.org /10.18653 /V1/P19-3019. However, similar statistical methods per-
form less well for larger models such as GPT-3 and GROVER; see Leon Fröhling and Arkaitz Zubiaga, “Feature-based detection
of automated language models: Tackling GPT-2, GPT-3 and Grover,” PeerJ Computer Science 7 (April 6, 2021): 1–23, ISSN:
23765992, https: //doi.org /10.7717 /peerj-cs.443. In addition, none of this research assumes a realistic, adversarial threat
model, in which attackers are aware that their posts are being assessed to potentially attribute machine authorship. Under
this more realistic scenario, attackers could deploy very easy countermeasures, such as altering temperature settings to sample
from a wider distribution of possible outputs in order to evade detection.

cember 10, 2021, https: //doi.org /10.48550 /arxiv.2112.05428.
139. As an example of a trivially circumventable strategy, AI developers could embed special “zero-width” characters in the
outputs of their models, which would not immediately be visible to users but which would easily be spotted by automated
monitoring tools. There is some research into the use of zero-width characters to attack large language models—see Nicholas
Boucher et al., “Bad Characters: Imperceptible NLP Attacks,” 2022 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy , June 2022, 1987–
2004, ISSN: 10816011, https: //doi.org /10.48550 /arxiv.2106.09898; Luca Pajola and Mauro Conti, “Fall of Giants: How
popular text-based MLaaS fall against a simple evasion attack,” Proceedings - 2021 IEEE European Symposium on Security and
Privacy, Euro S and P 2021 , April 2021, 198–211, https: //doi.org /10.48550 /arxiv.2104.05996-but little research into their
use as a defensive strategy, in large part because an attacker who was aware that such characters were being inserted into
model outputs could easily just remove them before posting content online.
43Criteria Assessment
Technical Feasibility It is an open technical question whether developers will be able to build
models that produce detectable outputs.
Social Feasibility To be implemented effectively, detectable models would require input
and coordination across deployers of large language models, which may
be socially infeasible.
Downside Risk There are few obvious downside risks to developing detectable models,
assuming there is a low false-positive rate.
Impact If most or all models are detectable, then inﬂuence operations with
language models will be easily discoverable.
5.2.2 AI Developers Build Models That Are More Fact-Sensitive
The dominant paradigm in natural language generation emphasizes “realism” in text generation over
other possible values. Models are trained to generate text that effectively mimics (some subsample of)
human text, without inherent regard for the truthfulness of the claims that it makes.140This means that
false claims that are commonly believed may be just as likely for a model to produce as true claims under
the current dominant approach to training language models.141
It may be possible to train AI models in such a way that they are incentivized to make more factually
grounded claims, which could produce models that carry less risk of producing falsehoods even if they
were accessible to bad actors.142Signiﬁcant progress has been made in this area by training models that
make use of web searches to improve the factual content of their responses, or that use reinforcement
learning techniques to reward more factually correct responses—though these approaches embed their
own set of biases about which claims count as “true” or “correct.”143Other methods attempt to modify
the text output to be well-supported by evidence.144While these methods are far from perfect, they can
signiﬁcantly reduce the risk that language models will produce misinformation during ordinary usage.
Nonetheless, most successful inﬂuence operations include, or build from, claims that have a kernel of
truth.145Even a language model that produced no false claims could still be used to produce politically
slanted or unfalsiﬁable statements, to shift public attention and discourse, or to engineer false beliefs
due to selective context and inauthentic authorship. In fact, in the hands of the right operator, a model
that stuck closely to the truth in its outputs might be more persuasive than a model that frequently lied.
140. For instance, language models trained on large quantities of internet text will be trained on a large amount of ﬁction,
which can lead them to substitute creative writing for facts.
141. True claims are often a narrow target. Large language models such as GPT-3 are not necessarily truthful by default. See

44And further, if this mitigation did meaningfully make it harder for propagandists to misuse language
models, it would still require coordination across AI developers to ensure that malicious actors do not
simply gravitate toward models that were not trained using similar methods. Finally, to be up to date
with the current state of the world, models might have to be retrained very frequently—a requirement
that may impose prohibitive costs.
Criteria Assessment
Technical Feasibility AI developers are exploring ways to make models more fact sensitive,
with promising signs of improvement.
Social Feasibility For the mitigation to be fully implemented, it would require a high
degree of coordination between developers of models.
Downside Risk If language models are more truthful, they may be more persuasive and
in turn inadvertently improve the persuasive capabilities of
propagandists.
Impact More truthful language models may be less likely to spread blatant
misinformation, but can still serve inﬂuence operations relying on true,
non-falsiﬁable, or politically slanted content.
5.2.3 Developers Spread Radioactive Data to Make Generative Models Detectable
Above, we described that AI developers could attempt to insert “radioactive data” into their datasets
when training language models in order to create more detectable outputs. A drawback of this ap-
proach is that it requires signiﬁcant coordination—radioactive data must be inserted by each developer
into their own training pipeline. Alternatively, AI researchers, media companies, or governments them-
selves could choose to proliferate radioactive data directly onto the internet, in locations where it would
likely be scooped up by any organization hoping to train a new language model.146This would require
far less coordination and could potentially make AI outputs more detectable for all future language
models. However, this would not affect models that have already been trained, and may be ineffective
if developers take steps to ﬁlter their training data—a procedure that is common when training models.
This strategy would require proliferators to engage in secretive posting of large amounts of content
online, which raises strong ethical concerns regarding the authority of any government or company to
deliberately reshape the internet so drastically. In addition, this mitigation would only affect language
models trained in the same language in which the radioactive data itself was written. It is also unclear
how much of the internet would need to be “radioactive” in this way to meaningfully affect models. And,
perhaps most importantly, it remains deeply unclear if this approach would actually result in models with
more detectable outputs, for the reasons discussed previously in Section 5.2.1. It seems likely that, even
with the use of radioactive training data, detecting synthetic text will remain far more difﬁcult than
detecting synthetic image or video content.
146. Similar proposals have been advanced in the domain of visual deepfakes, as a way of increasing the likelihood that
synthetic images produced from the most common models will be detectable to defenders. Hwang, Deepfakes: A Grounded
Threat Assessment .
45Criteria Assessment
Technical Feasibility While approaches to inserting radioactive data exist for images, it is
unclear if this would work for text.
Social Feasibility A well-resourced actor could unilaterally spread radioactive content
that would likely be included in training data for future models.
Downside Risk Large-scale, secret proliferation of data online raises signiﬁcant
concerns about the desirability of any one group changing the
distribution of content on the internet so drastically.
Impact It is unclear whether this retraining would result in more detectable
outputs, and thus detectable inﬂuence operations.
5.2.4 Governments Impose Restrictions on Data Collection
The basis of any large language model is a vast quantity of training data in the form of text generated
by real humans. While some of this data is typically taken from relatively structured sources such as
Wikipedia, a large majority of data usually comes from tools like Common Crawl that scrape the web
for publicly available text.147Regulatory or legal changes that would make this type of scraping more
difﬁcult to conduct might slow the growth of large language models, while simultaneously forcing de-
velopers to focus on extracting information from more structured sources.148
These changes could be grounded in changes to federal data privacy laws. Regulations that require
internet users to be informed about what their personal data is used for—such as the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU—may slow down large language model development.149At the
extreme end, governments could try to prohibit organizations from mass scraping the web for content at
all. More targeted measures could aim at improving cybersecurity for personalized data on social media
147. CommonCrawl freely publishes its archives of web data. See “So you’re ready to get started.,” Common Crawl, accessed
June 27, 2022, https: //commoncrawl.org /the-data /get-started /. But anyone can build their own software for web scraping
or use other tools to extract data from websites.
148. This would in turn have two follow-on effects: learning language from more factually grounded, more formal sources
like online news or encyclopedia articles might make models more likely to produce true statements, while also making them
signiﬁcantly less capable of mimicking the language of highly speciﬁc target demographics. On using data restrictions to make
language models more truthful, see Evans et al., “Truthful AI: Developing and governing AI that does not lie”: 63.
149. Article 14 of the GDPR requires companies that engage in web scraping of personal information regarding EU citizens
to inform data subjects that their personal information has been collected and to grant them certain rights regarding the use
of their data. See Regulation (EU) 2016 /679 of the European Parliament and the Council of 27 April 2016 on the Protection
of Natural Persons with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of Such Data, and Repealing
Directive 95 /46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), 2016 O.J. L 119 /1, art. 14. Major exemptions to this requirement
do exist that would likely protect the scraping of textual data for the purposes of scientiﬁc research into language models
(see ibid., art. 14(5)(b)); however, it is less clear to what extent GDPR may force companies looking to develop commercial
AI models to identify impacted data subjects and expressly inform them of their inclusion in a training dataset. Due to the
possibility of membership inference attacks on models that could be used to infer personal information about EU citizens, other
components of the GDPR relating to protection of personal data may also be implicated in situations where AI developers use
web scraping to create training datasets. For research into membership inference, see Nicolas Papernot et al., “Semi-supervised
Knowledge Transfer for Deep Learning from Private Training Data,” 5th International Conference on Learning Representations,
ICLR 2017 - Conference Track Proceedings , October 2016, https: //doi.org /10.48550 /arxiv.1610.05755; and Reza Shokri et
al., “Membership Inference Attacks against Machine Learning Models,” Proceedings - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy ,
October 2016, 3–18, ISSN: 10816011, https: //doi.org /10.48550 /arxiv.1610.05820. At minimum, at least one company has
been ﬁned for non-compliance with Article 14 of the GDPR; see “Poland: First GDPR ﬁne triggers controversial discussions,”
ePrivacy Blog, May 17, 2019, https: //blog.eprivacy.eu /?p=544. This suggests that even if GDPR does not actually prohibit
data scraping (including of personal information) for the purposes of language model construction, companies may feel that
it is necessary to spend signiﬁcantly more on lawyers and compliance efforts to avoid running afoul of the law.
46platforms or prohibiting foreign acquisition of major platforms.150
These mitigations are signiﬁcantly out of step with the current regulatory environment in the United
States, which has not yet passed any comprehensive data privacy laws.151The Supreme Court has also
recently ruled that scraping publicly available data from the web, even in violation of a terms of service
agreement, does not violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the primary cybersecurity law in the
United States.152Moreover, comprehensive data privacy laws that signiﬁcantly affect the ability of lan-
guage model developers to collect data may have large effects in other industries, while also having an
uncertain ability to constrain developers outside of the United States. If implemented poorly, data pro-
tection measures may harm researchers’ ability to detect and develop countermeasures against inﬂuence
campaigns more than they hinder campaign planners.153
Beyond language models, it may be more feasible to regulate the collection or resale of image or video
data. Speciﬁc state-level laws, like the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), restrict the
ability of AI developers to scrape speciﬁc types of data—most often pictures of private individuals’
faces—without informed consent.154Such laws have occasionally resulted in successful legal action
against AI developers, as when the ACLU successfully used BIPA to compel Clearview AI to screen out
data from Illinois residents in its model training pipeline and to sharply limit access to its facial recog-
nition tools within Illinois.155Limiting access to relevant training data can meaningfully disrupt the
creation of models that can later be used maliciously; at the same time, to the extent that such limita-
tions are possible at all, they will likely be feasible only for certain restricted sets of training data, such
as social media posts or images of private individuals’ faces.
Criteria Assessment
Technical Feasibility Governmental policy to penalize data collection is likely possible
without technical innovation; however, preventing access to
internet-based training data is likely difﬁcult.
Social Feasibility More extreme forms of data access restrictions would require high
political will.
Downside Risk Limiting training data will negatively harm legitimate industries that
may rely on language models or their training data and could
undermine future detection models.
Impact Without restricting data collection for all actors, impact is likely limited.

475.2.5 Governments Impose Controls on AI Hardware
Another path toward limiting the construction of large language models involves either limiting access
to or monitoring the usage of AI hardware.156This could be achieved in a number of ways, including
restrictions on the amount of computing power that individual organizations can use to train AI models,
disclosure requirements for all AI projects requiring more than a certain threshold of computing power,
or export controls on specialized chips.
Monitoring computing power usage may be difﬁcult; some estimates suggest that a model 200 times
larger than the current largest language model could be trained using less than 0.5% of worldwide cloud
computing resources.157Even if major expenditures of computing power could reliably be identiﬁed and
tracked, this power is a highly general resource; there is currently little way to tell that an organization
purchasing a large amount of computing power is planning to train a large language model as opposed
to, say, running climate simulations. However, increasing differentiation between AI compute and non-
AI compute could make this easier in the future.158
Monitoring for large models is currently a difﬁcult task, but semiconductor manufacturing equipment
(SME) export controls or restrictions on access to cloud computing resources are easier to implement.
In October 2022, the US government announced export controls on semiconductors, SMEs, and chip
design software directed at China.159These controls could slow the growth in computing power in China,
which may meaningfully affect their ability to produce future language models. Extending such controls
to other jurisdictions seems feasible as the semiconductor supply chain is extremely concentrated.160
Another (not mutually exclusive) restriction could involve mandating (or cloud computing companies
could voluntarily implement) approval processes for projects requiring enough computing power to build
a sophisticated language model. Even simply mandating stock and ﬂow accounting of high-end AI chips
could help identify which actors are capable of producing large language models.
To be effective, export controls on computing hardware need to be properly enforced and handle cases
such as stockpiling of chips, re-exports via other jurisdictions, and so on. Computing hardware restric-
tions could also incentivize nation-states to accelerate their indigenous production of AI chips, though
some reports argue that it is infeasible for China to scale up the domestic production of SME.161Fur-
thermore, for the purpose of controlling language model development (or even AI development), export

48controls on hardware are a blunt instrument and have far-reaching consequences on global trade and
many non-AI industries.162Finally, it is worth keeping in mind that often the most impactful propa-
gandists—governments themselves—are those with the capability to plausibly circumvent the hardware
restrictions mentioned above.
Criteria Assessment
Technical Feasibility Some hardware-related controls would not require any technical
innovation; however, this likely varies signiﬁcantly.
Social Feasibility Restrictions on semiconductors and SMEs have been applied to China;
cloud computing restrictions could also be done unilaterally or
voluntarily.
Downside Risk Export controls on semiconductors or semiconductor manufacturing
equipment could escalate geopolitical tensions and hurt legitimate
businesses.
Impact US export controls would largely affect the development of future
language models in other jurisdictions.
5.3 Model Access
Once models are built, developers can choose how users interact with them. AI providers have some
actions available to them that might reduce bad actors’ access to generative language models. At the
same time, these actions could be highly costly for organizations looking to commercialize their models
and would require large amounts of cooperation across all relevant AI providers to ensure that propa-
gandists could not simply gravitate toward other equally capable models without similar restrictions in
place.
5.3.1 AI Providers Impose Stricter Controls on Language Models
As discussed in Section 2, the access regimes governing today’s large language models generally fall into
one of three categories: fully private, fully public, or private but accessible under restricted conditions,
such as the use of gated API access. Access to many of the most powerful current large language models is
partially available through APIs, which provides developers with a number of choices regarding potential
access or use restrictions that could be imposed upon their models:
1. Developers could require potential users to submit the proposed purposes for which they intend
to use a model, and revoke access if actual usage appears to diverge too far from this proposal.
This type of restriction was originally a core component of OpenAI’s API access regime, though it
has since been replaced with a faster, more automated sign-up process.163
2. Even if the above proposal is adopted, individuals granted API access may often seek to build
applications—for instance, chatbots—that give other end users the ability to indirectly input text
162. Jordan Schneider and Irene Zhang, “New Chip Export Controls and the Sullivan Tech Doctrine with Kevin Wolf,” Chi-
naTalk, October 11, 2022, https: //www.chinatalk.media /p/new-chip-export-controls-explained.
163. Bryan Walsh, “OpenAI’s GPT-3 gets a little bit more open,” Axios, November 18, 2021, https: //www.axios.com /2021 /

49to a model. These types of applications may indirectly expose the model to bad actors. Developers
could therefore impose access restrictions that forbid API users from creating applications that
give other users the ability to input arbitrary text to the model.
3. Developers might choose to restrict model access to only trusted institutions, such as known com-
panies and research organizations, and not to individuals or governments likely to use their access
to spread disinformation. Huawei initially appears to have intended an access regime along these
lines for its PanGu- amodel.164
4. Developers could further limit the number of outputs that individual users can generate within a
certain period of time, or they could require review of users who seem to be submitting anoma-
lously large numbers of queries. This would limit the scale of inﬂuence operations that rely on
language models, but might not prevent their use in more tailored cases (such as generating a
smaller number of news articles).
5. Where API access is granted, developers might also impose restrictions on the types of inputs
that users are allowed to submit. For instance, the image-generating model DALL•E 2 attempts
to screen out user-submitted queries that are intended to produce “violent, adult, or political”
outputs.165Such efforts may require signiﬁcant effort to keep them up to date as new controversial
issues arise.
This does not represent an exhaustive list of potential access restrictions. All such restrictions, however,
share certain downsides. First, effective restrictions may be difﬁcult for developers to implement, espe-
cially if they require manual review or appeal processes. Second, organizations looking to commercialize
their models have strong incentives to forego onerous review processes on potential customers. Third,
user restrictions are only effective if enough institutions implement strong enough access restrictions
to box out bad actors; otherwise, propagandists can simply gravitate toward models with less severe
restrictions.
In other words, this proposed mitigation has the makings of a classic collective action problem: the most
effective outcome requires coordination across multiple actors, each of whom has incentives to default.
In addition, the proposal can only be effective so long as there are no publicly released models that are
as effective and easy to use as those maintained by AI developers behind API restrictions. However, if
public models are sufﬁcient for propagandists, then this mitigation will likely be less effective.
Despite these limitations, strong industry norms—including norms enforced by industry standards or
government regulation—could still make widespread adoption of strong access restrictions possible. As
long as there is a signiﬁcant gap between the most capable open-source model and the most capable
API-controlled model, the imposition of monitoring controls can deny hostile actors some ﬁnancial ben-
eﬁt.166Cohere, OpenAI, and AI21 have already collaborated to begin articulating norms around access
to large language models, but it remains too early to tell how widely adopted, durable, and forceful
these guidelines will prove to be.167

165. “Curbing Misuse at Dall-E 2,” OpenAI, accessed June 27, 2022, https: //openai.com /dall-e-2 /.
166. For a quantitative justiﬁcation as to why, even if there are good public models available, restrictions on access to (better)
private models can still impose non-negligible costs on propagandists, see Musser, “A Cost Analysis of Generative Language
Models and Inﬂuence Operations.”
167. “Best Practices for Deploying Language Models,” Cohere, June 2, 2022, https: //txt.cohere.ai /best-practices-for-deployi
ng-language-models /.
50Finally, there may be alternatives to APIs as a method for AI developers to provide restricted access. For
example, some work has proposed imposing controls on who can use models by only allowing them
to work on specialized hardware—a method that may help with both access control and attribution.168
Another strand of work is around the design of licenses for model use.169Further exploration of how to
provide restricted access is likely valuable.
Criteria Assessment
Technical Feasibility Some AI developers already restrict usage of models behind APIs.
Social Feasibility Limiting how AI providers’ language models are used reﬂects a
collective action problem: it requires coordination across AI providers,
each of whom has an incentive to defect.
Downside Risk Limiting access concentrates more power in the hands of a few AI
providers and risks undermining those who could beneﬁt from model
use.
Impact If AI developers are governed by norms of restricted use, it could
mitigate the potential of AI-enabled inﬂuence operations. However, this
assumes comparable open-source model developers do not exist.
5.3.2 AI Providers Develop New Norms Around Model Release
Traditionally, AI researchers have felt bound by what Thomas Merton referred to as the “communism of
the scientiﬁc ethos,” a norm that holds that a willingness to share information in the interests of full and
open collaboration is integral to the scientiﬁc enterprise.170This norm is not merely a behavioral quirk of
scientists; the free and open ﬂow of information is critical for the advancement of science and technology
as a whole, and progress in AI has long rested on strong norms of openness and collaboration. But as
AI models become increasingly lucrative, this norm is challenged by a competing instinct to privatize
models and data in order to commercialize them. In addition, norms of openness in AI research are
challenged by safety concerns associated with powerful models that open up new attacks, including the
scalable epistemic attacks made possible by powerful language models.171
Norms regarding data sharing and model release are currently in ﬂux, largely due to progress in large
language models. OpenAI has twice broken previous norms regarding model release, ﬁrst by choosing
to delay a full release of GPT-2 in order “to give people time to assess the properties of these models,
discuss their societal implications, and evaluate the impacts of release after each stage,” and then again
a year later by choosing not to release GPT-3 at all, instead commercializing it behind an API paywall.172
Both of these decisions drew serious criticism at the time, though the use of an API in lieu of a full model
release now appears to be somewhat common among AI providers capable of producing cutting-edge

51language models.173In the domain of text-to-image models, a sitting member of Congress recently urged
the US National Security Advisor and the acting director of the Ofﬁce of Science and Technology Policy
to address the “unsafe releases” of text-to-image models that do not have content restrictions, because
they have been used to generate dangerous images.174
While we do not make speciﬁc claims about the substance of desirable research norms, a growing body of
research is dedicated to examining the types of norms that could be developed to govern AI research, es-
pecially in the sphere of large language models. These norms could include staged release of models, the
adoption of tradeoff frameworks to assess the risks of open-sourcing models, mechanisms for accepting
public feedback and reports of misuse, and prepublication safety review.175Implementing any of these
norms may require new institutional mechanisms, such as a Partnership on AI-style176organization for
natural language processing researchers, the creation of a clear set of principles around issues like data
collection and model release for large language models, or formal principles regarding what type of
risk assessment is expected of AI developers prior to model release.177These institutional mechanisms
could help solidify new norms around model design, model release, and model access and would have
the potential to signiﬁcantly impact the ability of propagandists to make use of large language models.
Criteria Assessment
Technical Feasibility This mitigation does not require technical innovation.
Social Feasibility The development of norms around language model release for
cutting-edge models requires coordination, and open-source developers
may choose to ignore those norms.
Downside Risk Norms that restrict model release may concentrate know-how in the
hands of a smaller number of AI providers and impede beneﬁcial AI
progress.
Impact The mitigation would be useful for restricting access to current and
future cutting-edge models, but this is unlikely to prevent propagandists
from gaining access to already-public models.
5.3.3 AI Providers Close Security Vulnerabilities
Actors seeking to make use of AI-generated content for propaganda may not be constrained by formal
access restrictions to relevant models and research. They may employ covert espionage to steal mod-
els and information that will enable construction of their own models, or they may aim to engage in

52cyberattacks or other forms of sabotage that allow them to manipulate the outputs of already existing
language models.178For instance, language model poisoning or supply chain attacks on AI providers
may allow adversaries to output propaganda from language models they do not possess—manipulating
them from afar.179Similarly, threat actors may also seek to obtain access to cutting-edge, non-public
generative models through human vulnerabilities and insider threats at AI institutions.
By developing or hiring groups to simulate adversary attempts to gain access to cutting-edge model ca-
pabilities, AI providers can identify and reduce vulnerabilities. Such red-teaming exercises should search
not just for cybersecurity vulnerabilities, but also ways in which insider threats or mathematically so-
phisticated attacks on the AI training process could result in compromised models. Such red teaming can
inform a holistic assessment on the risk of the model being misused or applied to produce propaganda.
However, while red teaming may successfully identify some vulnerabilities, it is unlikely that all can be
caught, and for many types of vulnerabilities that appear to be inherent in modern AI systems, it is un-
clear how successful any form of technical mitigation can be. Moreover, closing security vulnerabilities
is only useful in the context of AI models that have not been made publicly available, as propagandists
looking to make use of public models would not need to surreptitiously steal or compromise such models.
Criteria Assessment
Technical Feasibility Some red-teaming exercises can be performed today, but some defense
methods for protecting valuable cyber assets remain research problems.
Social Feasibility Individual AI developers can implement this mitigation unilaterally.
Downside Risk There are no obvious downside risks.
Impact Closing security vulnerabilities is useful insofar as future models are
superior for propaganda purposes than already-public models.
5.4 Content Dissemination
AI-generated content is ultimately only a threat if it reaches and inﬂuences real human beings. In general,
the interventions most likely to slow the spread of AI-generated propaganda may be those that could
be successful against all propaganda, AI-generated or not. However, in this section, we brieﬂy outline a
few mitigations that might speciﬁcally manage to slow the spread of AI-authored content.
5.4.1 Platforms and AI Providers Coordinate to Identify AI Content
It is not clear how companies should respond if or when they judge that content on their platforms
was generated by a language model. There are a wide number of plausibly legitimate use cases for
AI-generated content on social media, including brand chatbots designed to provide customer service,
178. For a taxonomy of the progression of machine learning vulnerabilities to adversarial inﬂuence and a series of case studies
on these threats, see “MITRE | ATLAS,” MITRE, accessed October 29, 2022, https: //atlas.mitre.org /.
179. For instance, in a “model spinning” attack, a threat actor can modify the model to output manipulated narratives whenever
a user inputs an adversary-selected trigger word, all without compromising performance. See Bagdasaryan and Shmatikov,
“Spinning Language Models: Risks of Propaganda-As-A-Service and Countermeasures.” For a general overview of the types
of attacks that can be used to target the mathematical peculiarities of AI systems, see Andrew Lohn, Hacking AI: A Primer
for Policymakers on Machine Learning Cybersecurity (Center for Security and Emerging Technology, December 2020), https:

53comedy bots meant to mimic or parody speciﬁc authors, or auto-generated news announcements.180
For this reason, it is unlikely that social media platforms would choose to simply issue a blanket ban on
AI-generated content.181
Even if platforms do not issue blanket bans, they might still build in rules regarding appropriate uses of
language models into their terms of service. Should accounts generating automated content be required
to publicly disclose the origin of content they post? Should posts determined to have been authored by
an AI be ﬂagged?182If platforms know that certain external sites host AI-generated content—especially
content of a political nature—without disclosing it as such, might that be in itself sufﬁcient grounds to
block links to those sites? All of these interventions could be plausible ways to reduce the spread of
AI-generated misinformation—assuming it can be identiﬁed as such.
Actually detecting content that comes from an AI model, however, is not trivial. Without the aid of AI
developers, social media platforms trying to identify machine authorship would be restricted to merely
looking for statistical patterns in text and user metadata.183Current tools for this do not provide the
level of conﬁdence that would likely be required for platforms to take disruptive action against accounts,
do not work on texts the length of a typical social media post, and are likely to perform worse as models
improve.184
However, collaboration between platforms and AI companies may make detection of larger-scale cam-
paigns using AI generation more feasible. For instance, model owners might store outputs so that they
180. Some of these types of uses already exist; for instance, the account dril_gpt2 on Twitter (https: //twitter.com /dril_gpt2)
uses GPT-2 to generate tweets in the style of the dadaist Twitter comedian dril.
181. Some social media companies have restrictive policies around the posting of AI-generated images, but even these poli-
cies are usually only applicable in certain cases—most commonly, when there is an (assumed) intent to deceive behind the
production of the image. See, for instance, Monica Bickert, “Enforcing Against Manipulated Media,” Meta , January 6, 2020,
https: //about.fb.com /news /2020 /01/enforcing-against-manipulated-media /, which contains the following explicit exemp-
tion: “This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire, or video that has been edited solely to omit or change the
order of words.” The same type of reasons that have led social media companies to avoid adopting blanket bans on AI-generated
visual content will also make blanket bans on AI-generated text content unlikely.
182. The impact of ﬂagging content as AI-generated on audiences’ belief formation processes is unknown and may be unintu-
itive; in one study, for instance, researchers found that survey respondents were just as likely to view “AI-generated” proﬁles of
Airbnb hosts as trustworthy, compared to human-authored proﬁles. However, when respondents were told that some proﬁles
were human-authored and some were AI-generated, they viewed the proﬁles they believed were AI-generated as less trust-
worthy than human-authored proﬁles. Maurice Jakesch et al., “AI-mediated communication: How the perception that proﬁle
text was written by AI affects trustworthiness,” CHI ’19: Proceedings of CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems ,
May 2019, https: //doi.org /10.1145 /3290605.3300469.
183. Humans and machine learning-based detection systems differ in their respective competencies, and can currently perform
better at detection together by covering each other’s blindspots. See Daphne Ippolito et al., “Automatic Detection of Generated
Text is Easiest when Humans are Fooled,” arXiv:1911.00650 [cs.CL ], July 2020, 1808–1822, https: //doi.org /10.48550 /arXiv.
1911.00650.
184. One possible statistical method for identifying AI-generated text is provided by Hendrik Strobelt and Sebastian Gehrmann,
“Catching a Unicorn with GLTR: A tool to detect automatically generated text,” gltr.io , accessed October 29, 2022, http: //gltr.
io/. But this method assumes that language models will sample text from a relatively constrained distribution, such that the
likelihood of unpredictable word patterns ends up signiﬁcantly lower than is observed in authentic human text. As language
models become larger, however, they become capable of accurately modeling a larger distribution of text, decreasing the risk
that they will fall into noticeable “most-likely-next-word” ruts. Additionally, many language models permit users to directly
manipulate a “temperature” setting, which directly serves to sample from a more unpredictable range of next word outputs
when generating text, thereby evading this detection tool more directly.
54can be traced back to the users who generated them.185Social media companies could then ﬂag content
on their platforms that they suspect may be inauthentic and work with AI companies to determine if any
was generated by a language model. This type of collaboration could have follow-on beneﬁts: once an
AI company ascertains that a user is reposting outputs to social media, they can work with platforms
to determine if other content generated by that user has been reposted to other social media platforms,
potentially catching other coordinated inauthentic accounts that the platforms may initially have missed.
This strategy would miss content that is posted to encrypted social media platforms, such as WhatsApp
channels. In addition, disinformation is also posted to social media platforms that do not support robust
search features and are unlikely to cooperate with AI companies to monitor content, such as Parler
and Gab, though it may still be possible to scan public posts on these sites for potential AI-generated
content.186Without collaboration from the platforms themselves, this mitigation strategy may have only
a limited impact.
Despite these drawbacks, partnerships between platforms and AI companies have certain advantages.
Unlike imposing onerous up-front access restrictions, this type of monitoring is less likely to alienate
potential users from signing up for API access to a language model, which may make it more attractive
to AI companies. While bad actors may want to avoid using AI services that engage in this type of
monitoring, AI companies can more easily maintain some secrecy about how they monitor for reposted
content, making it harder to evade monitoring mechanisms.
Criteria Assessment
Technical Feasibility Versions of this implementation may be feasible for monitoring publicly
posted content, but may be infeasible for encrypted social media
channels.
Social Feasibility Coordination between AI developers and social media companies
requires a signiﬁcant number of bilateral partnerships.
Downside Risk There are few obvious downside risks assuming the detection models
are accurate. If not, they risk ﬂagging the wrong accounts.
Impact The impact depends on the extent of collaboration between platforms
and AI companies, and will not cover all social platforms.
5.4.2 Platforms Require “Proof of Personhood” to Post
Current policies regarding social media usage range from not requiring any form of registration to re-
quiring that accounts be afﬁliated with real names and unique email addresses, and, at times, requiring
185. This strategy will necessarily be imperfect, as propagandists can always make small or trivial changes to model outputs
before posting them to social media. If detection relies on hash matches, operators may easily evade detection by doing so.
However, not all operators may be savvy enough to realize that detection makes use of hashes, so this strategy may still have
some usefulness. Relying on close-but-not-exact matches to output text, by contrast, introduces a higher level of statistical
uncertainty in attribution, though at sufﬁcient scales, campaigns with slightly altered text could still be linked to the use of an
AI model with meaningful conﬁdence.
186. For analyses of Parler and Gab, including an overview of the extent of their content moderation practices, see David Thiel et
al.,Contours and Controversies of Parler (Stanford Internet Observatory, 2021), https: //fsi.stanford.edu /publication /contours-

55users to submit “video selﬁes” for proof of personhood.187However, any of these approaches can be cir-
cumvented by malicious actors: they can register many “burner” email addresses to create fake accounts
and hire inexpensive labor to complete proof of humanness checks.
Platforms could, however, more uniformly require higher standards of proof of personhood in order
to verify that content is not being produced by an AI and reposted to their sites. This could involve
requiring more reliable forms of authentication when users sign up for an account, for instance, by
asking a user to take a live video of themselves posing, or asking for some alternative form of biometrics.
Alternatively, platforms could require users to occasionally pass tests to demonstrate humanness before
posting content; these tests could either be administered randomly, at periodic intervals, or when a
particular user is posting at a high volume. CAPTCHAs are one way to demonstrate humanness in this
way; however, a determined adversary can cheaply circumvent them. Outside of tests, another proposed
approach includes decentralized attestation of humanness.188
This mitigation would not make it impossible for propagandists to copy-paste content from a language
model into a social media platform and post it. Instead, it would be meant to disrupt operational setups
that rely on bots that directly query and post content from language models without explicit human
intervention. While this may only describe a minority of inﬂuence operations, having such a fully au-
tomated capability might be useful to propagandists; for instance, an account could be conﬁgured to
query a language model every few hours or days for an anodyne post with the intention of posting
it directly to a social media platform. Operators would then need only log in every so often to post
more explicitly political content, having fully automated the problem of enmeshing those political posts
in a more realistic-seeming environment of unrelated content. Requiring checks to post content could
meaningfully disrupt this type of operational setup.
There are several signiﬁcant limitations to this mitigation, including potential infringements on privacy,
limits to the types of operations it would mitigate, and limits to its effectiveness against operations by
determined adversaries. First, from a privacy perspective, user authentication requirements would likely
face resistance from users who are accustomed to an expectation of anonymity online, including users
who hold such expectations for very legitimate reasons. Second, hummanness veriﬁcations are designed
to address operations that rely on social media accounts to spread generated content, but do not affect
other information channels—like email or fake news websites. Third, as mentioned above, for well-
resourced actors like the Internet Research Agency, the costs of proof of humanness requirements may
not be meaningful deterrents: purchasing a new SIM card or hiring cheap outsourced labor to pass a
video test will not prevent these campaigns.
Finally, this mitigation introduces an underexplored potential for backlash: If platforms include a proof
of humanness check, and propagandists pass such a check, the successful completion could increase
the perceived credibility of the account—increasing the persuasive effect from the account in question.
Future research could address this question directly.

56Criteria Assessment
Technical Feasibility Various forms of human authentication have been piloted (and
implemented) already.
Social Feasibility Social media platforms and other websites can implement this
mitigation unilaterally.
Downside Risk More extreme forms of this mitigation would undermine online
anonymity, which can stiﬂe speech and undermine other human rights.
Impact The impact depends on the speciﬁc implementation: basic
CAPTCHA-like tests are gameable, but more novel implementations
may increase costs of waging AI-enabled inﬂuence campaigns.
5.4.3 Entities That Rely on Public Input Take Steps to Reduce Their Exposure to Misleading AI
Content
Many entities in society rely on public input for feedback, evidence of group beliefs, and legitimacy. For
example, when making decisions that affect the community, local planning commissions often seek public
comment to make informed decisions.189Similarly, private ﬁrms often ask for feedback on products, and
media outlets often ask for tips on the issues of the day. The processes that these entities use for public
comment constitute potential vectors for the abuse of language models to generate “comments” from
the public in order to sway policymakers, local ofﬁcials, or private entities.
Indeed, there have already been cases in which mass inauthentic comment campaigns have been iden-
tiﬁed in the US government, most notably when various technology companies submitted millions of
comments to the FCC in 2017 regarding net neutrality, falsely using real customers’ names to provide
a veneer of legitimacy to the comments.190Comments generated by a large language model would be
more difﬁcult to identify as coordinated, since the comments in the FCC case followed a standard out-
put and merely swapped synonyms for one another. As such, some level of reform to mechanisms for
soliciting public input may be called for.
At the lowest end, this reform could simply involve making entities that solicit public comment more
aware of the potential for inauthentic content being submitted that poses as public opinion. At the
same time, this may have negative externalities: priming policymakers to be suspicious of public input,
for example, may itself undermine democratic responsiveness.191Organizations soliciting public input
might instead choose to implement stronger methods than common CAPTCHAs to ensure that public
comments are authentic; currently, many US agencies simply assume that comments are legitimate and
189. In the US context, each branch of the US government has mechanisms for soliciting input from members of the public.
For Congress, the most common form of input is constituent calls or emails to their representatives; for the judicial system,
the amicus brief provides a means for non-parties to a case to comment on its merits; and for executive agencies, the period
of public comment required by the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) allows agencies to understand how affected parties
might view proposed regulations.

57perform no follow-up on submitted comments.192Here, entities inviting comment will have to ensure
that attempts to prevent AI-generated comments do not create frictions that prevent members of the
public from participating.193
Criteria Assessment
Technical Feasibility Basic defenses—like user authentication—to prevent bots from
overwhelming public comment boards already exist.
Social Feasibility Policy change will likely require coordination across multiple parts of
government.
Downside Risk Signiﬁcant changes may disincentivize members of the public from
participating in public comment periods.
Impact The impact varies depending on the speciﬁc implementation, but could
make public input solicitation much more robust.
5.4.4 Digital Provenance Standards Are Widely Adopted
Because technical detection of AI-generated text is challenging, an alternate approach is to build trust
by exposing consumers to information about how a particular piece of content is created or changed.
Tools such as phone cameras or word processing software could build the means for content creators to
track and disclose this information.194In turn, social media platforms, browsers, and internet protocols
could publicize these indicators of authenticity when a user interacts with content.
This intervention requires a substantial change to a whole ecosystem of applications and infrastructure in
order to ensure that content retains indicators of authenticity as it travels across the internet. To this end,
the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) has brought together software application
vendors, hardware manufacturers, provenance providers, content publishers, and social media platforms
to propose a technical standard for content provenance that can be implemented across the internet.195
This standard would provide information about content to consumers, including its date of creation,
authorship, hardware, and details regarding edits, all of which would be validated with cryptographic
signatures.196
Theoretically, this standard would work for AI-generated content, particularly if AI-as-a-service compa-

Selected Agencies Should Fully Describe Public Comment Data and Their Limitations,” U.S. GAO , September 2021, https:
//www.gao.gov /products /gao-21-103181. The GAO study found that, for some agencies, as many as 30% of individuals
whose email addresses were associated with public comments reported not having written the comment submitted under their
name. Many other agencies did not require email addresses or other types of identifying information for submitted comments,
signiﬁcantly reducing the ability of the agency to authenticate the identity of the commenter.
193. In the US context, a stronger version could be that the APA itself is amended to mandate some level of vetting for the
authenticity of public comments, or criminal liability could be imposed for institutions found to be impersonating members
of the public. We do note, however, that the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) has so far preferred not
to propose any sweeping changes to the period for public comment. In part, this is because ACUS believes that AI-generated
comments could have valuable use cases in the public comment process, such as by generating summaries of public comments
or lowering barriers to submitting public comments. See Balla et al., Mass, Computer-Generated, and Fraudulent Comments

58nies opt in to self-declare authorship for each piece of content and require applications or individuals
accessing their services through API to do the same. Over time, users may learn to trust the content that
has provenance markers and distrust content that lacks them. However, these protocols cannot authen-
ticate preexisting legacy content. In addition, while these measures can provide greater transparency
about the creation, history, and distribution of ﬁles—including images and text ﬁles generated by word
processing applications—they cannot provide a means for authenticating and tracking the spread of raw
text, which can be copied and pasted from ﬁle to ﬁle without leaving a record in a speciﬁc ﬁle’s history. To
authenticate text provenance widely would require radical changes to internet protocols. For example, it
is possible that the HTTP protocol would have to be modiﬁed to embed content provenance information.
Since language models output raw text and not ﬁles, simply storing provenance information in ﬁles is
sharply limited in its ability to help track the spread of AI-generated misinformation. More low-level
changes may be needed to maximize the impact of this intervention.
If the provenance information for a piece of content contains information about the user, then this
intervention would raise privacy risks.197This implementation could threaten anonymous speech on
the internet. However, if only information to distinguish AI and human-generated content is added,
then the privacy risks are lower.
Criteria Assessment
Technical Feasibility Promising technical paths exist, but the technology has not yet been
proven.
Social Feasibility Some progress has been made in coordinating between interested
parties, but robust versions of this mitigation would require massive
coordination challenges.
Downside Risk Adding author information raises privacy risks.
Impact Radical changes to guarantee content provenance would have high
impact, but more feasible options would likely have limited impact.
5.5 Belief Formation
The preceding mitigations address the supply of AI-generated misinformation. However, as long as target
audiences remain susceptible to propaganda that aligns with their beliefs, there will remain an incentive
for inﬂuence operations generally, as well as incentives more speciﬁcally for propagandists to leverage
AI to make those operations more effective. In this section, we therefore discuss two interventions
that might help address the demand side of the misinformation problem: media literacy campaigns,
and the use of AI tools to aid media consumers in interpreting and making informed choices about the
information they receive.
197. For more discussion of privacy risks here, see “Ticks or it didn’t happen,” WITNESS Media Lab, December 2019, https:
//lab.witness.org /ticks-or-it-didnt-happen /.
595.5.1 Institutions Engage in Media Literacy Campaigns
There is some evidence that media literacy campaigns can increase individuals’ ability to discern between
real and fake news online.198Existing media literacy tools that teach people how to “spot” coordinated
accounts online, however, sometimes emphasize traits or mistakes that AI tools can avoid making, such
as repetitiveness or a lack of “personal” content interspersed with more political content.199If current
programs become outdated, media literacy will require updating. For example, if language models over-
come repetition and lack of “personal” content, literacy campaigns can still combat the goals of the
propagandists by teaching people to fact-check content in articles and to distinguish objective informa-
tion from false, misleading, or slanted content.200These campaigns may have less impact, however, on
distraction operations that crowd out genuine news.
Unlike many of the other mitigations listed above, the impact of media literacy campaigns is agnostic
to human versus computer authorship. These efforts focus on teaching people how to analyze content,
not necessarily to spot AI-generated content. Another form of digital literacy campaigns could be to
teach people about AI-generated content speciﬁcally. If new “telltale” signs can be identiﬁed that rep-
resent common indicators of AI-powered inﬂuence operations, then this mitigation could be beneﬁcial.
However, if the most that can be said of AI-powered operations is that they look more authentic than
human-operated campaigns, then this strategy may be misplaced. Emphasizing that any account on the
internet could be an AI-powered bot may make people more likely to simply dismiss arguments they
disagree with as inauthentic and not worth paying attention to, thereby exacerbating societal division
and polarization. Overemphasizing the prevalence and danger of misinformation online may ultimately
serve the same goal that propagandists themselves are often trying to achieve: making people inherently
distrustful of any information or argument that conﬂicts with their preexisting beliefs.201
Criteria Assessment
Technical Feasibility No technical innovation is required.
Social Feasibility A variety of actors could unilaterally lead educational campaigns.
Downside Risk Educating about the threat of AI-enabled inﬂuence operations could
reduce trust in genuine content or in online information environments
more broadly.
Impact Educational initiatives could help people distinguish reliable
information from misinformation or slanted text, and mitigate the
effects of inﬂuence operations (AI-generated or not).

605.5.2 Developers Provide Consumer-Focused AI Tools
Just as generative models can be used to generate propaganda, they may also be used to defend against
it. Consumer-focused AI tools could help information consumers identify and critically evaluate content
or curate accurate information. These tools may serve as an antidote to inﬂuence operations and could
reduce the demand for disinformation. While detection methods (discussed in Section 5.2.1) aim to
detect whether content is synthetic, consumer-focused tools instead try to equip consumers to make
better decisions when evaluating the content they encounter.
Possibilities for such tools are numerous.202Developers could produce browser extensions and mobile
applications that automatically attach warning labels to potential generated content and fake accounts,
or that selectively employ ad-blockers to demonetize them. Websites and customizable notiﬁcation sys-
tems could be built or improved with AI-augmented vetting, scoring, and ranking systems to organize,
curate, and display user-relevant information while sifting out unveriﬁed or generated sources.203Tools
and built-in search engines that merely help users quickly contextualize the content they consume could
help their users evaluate claims, while lowering the risk of identifying true articles as misinformation.204
Such “contextualization engines” may be especially helpful in enabling users to analyze a given source
and then ﬁnd both related high-quality sources and areas where relevant data is missing. By reducing
the effort required to launch deeper investigations, such tools can help to align web trafﬁc revenue more
directly with user goals, as opposed to those of advertisers or inﬂuence operators.205Another proposal
suggests using AI-generated content to educate and inoculate a population against misleading beliefs.206
Some of the most promising AI-enabled countermeasures may leverage state-of-the-art generative mod-
els themselves, to reshift the offense-defense balance in favor of information consumers.207As generative
models get better at producing persuasive arguments that exploit viewer biases and blindspots, defen-
sive generative models could be used to help users detect and explain ﬂaws in tailored arguments or to
ﬁnd artifacts in manipulated images.208Generative models that help users ﬁnd relevant information can
also be trained how to “show their work” by citing sources that support their answers.209Such methods
could serve as building blocks for future tools that augment a consumer’s ability to critically evaluate
202. For a variety of examples of consumer-focused tools that help users control the information they see, see Combatting
Online Harms Through Innovation, Report to Congress (Federal Trade Commission, June 16, 2022), https: //www.ftc.gov /
reports /combatting-online-harms-through-innovation.
203. A particularly successful example of a curation tool is Live Universal Awareness Map, which has done near real-time source
aggregation on conﬂicts in Ukraine and Syria while aiming to ﬁlter out state-sponsored propaganda. On karma and reputation
systems, see Seger et al., Tackling threats to informed decision-making in democratic societies: Promoting epistemic security in a
technologically-advanced world ; and Christian Johnson and William Marcellino, Bad Actors in News Reporting: Tracking News

204. The issue of false positives—identifying quality sources as misleading or false—is common with social media fact-checking
recommendation systems, which often superﬁcially associate new accurate articles with prior false ones, or fail to differentiate
between false claims and claims that are contingent, probabilistic, or predictive in nature.

61information.
Consumer-focused tools may also go beyond the individual, with more expensive, AI-enabled intelligence
services that offer tools to businesses, governments, and other organizations that aim to increase their
awareness of, and improve their responses to, inﬂuence operations.
Despite their prospective beneﬁts, AI tools will also present risks. They are likely to be susceptible to
forms of social bias, just as current models are. Defensive generative models that are aligned with
consumer incentives may also exacerbate conﬁrmation bias, as consumers may prefer information that
tailors to their preexisting biases. Social media companies may make it difﬁcult or against their policies
for externally developed tools to interface with their platforms, both to protect privacy and to sustain user
engagement. While social media companies may be in a good position to provide their own defensive
AI tools, the divergence between their interests and those of their users would likely exceed that of
third-party tool providers. Accordingly, tools created by platforms could also serve to discourage more
effective policy action and to justify disabling the use of third-party tools that aren’t as aligned with
platform objectives.210
More powerful versions of web-searching generative models may also pose new unique risks if their
range of action and reinforcable behavior is not carefully constrained. For models that are capable of
generating and inputting text queries within other websites to ﬁnd more relevant results, the incentive
to return useful results could reward fraudulent behavior (e.g., editing and returning Wikipedia results
if there aren’t good sources211). While many such speciﬁc imagined threats are highly unlikely, the
potential impacts of defensive generative models on search engine trafﬁc and the internet itself should
be accounted for.
Overall, consumer-focused AI tools provide a variety of opportunities to head off the impact of inﬂuence
operations that employ stronger generative models, but they will require high-quality implementation.
Criteria Assessment
Technical Feasibility Creating AI tools that help people reason or highlight factual
inaccuracies is an ongoing research problem, but some promising
directions exist.
Social Feasibility Some progress could be achieved unilaterally by researchers or
entrepreneurs, but coordination with social media platforms would be
required for broader effect.
Downside Risk AI tools may be susceptible to bias, and people could become overly
reliant on them.
Impact If implemented well, defensive AI tools could have a big impact in
helping consumers form accurate beliefs.
210. For example, the use of such tools could be used to impress Congress with a platform’s efforts, and to make the argument
that users already have plenty of options to seek out or control the information they are exposed to, even if in practice the
tools are designed to discourage use.

626 Conclusions
While each of the mitigations discussed above are important to weigh on their own merits, there are
some crosscutting conclusions that we offer to policymakers trying to think through the problem of AI-
powered inﬂuence operations. Our shared assessments of these mitigations lead to the following main
conclusions:
1. Language models are likely to signiﬁcantly impact the future of inﬂuence operations.
2. There are no silver bullets for minimizing the risk of AI-generated disinformation.
3. New institutions and coordination (like collaboration between AI providers and social media plat-
forms) are needed to collectively respond to the threat of (AI-powered) inﬂuence operations.
4. Mitigations that address the supply of mis- or disinformation without addressing the demand for
it are only partial solutions.
5. More research is needed to fully understand the threat of AI-powered inﬂuence operations as well
as the feasibility of proposed mitigations.
6.1 Language Models Will Likely Change Inﬂuence Operations
As outlined in Section 4, language models have the potential to signiﬁcantly affect how inﬂuence op-
erations are waged in the future—including the actors waging these campaigns, the behaviors of the
propagandists, and the content included.
Actors: If generative models become widely accessible, it will drive down the cost of producing
propaganda; in turn, those who have refrained from waging inﬂuence operations in the past may
no longer be disinclined. Private PR and marketing ﬁrms may develop knowledge in how to most
effectively integrate these models, and thus serve as a resource and scapegoat for political actors
seeking to outsource their campaigns.
Behaviors: Language models offer to change how inﬂuence operations are waged. They may be
deployed for dynamic generation of responses, automated cross-platform testing, and other novel
techniques. Although we described a few new possible behaviors in this report, we suspect pro-
pagandists will use these models in unforeseen ways in response to the defensive measures that
evolve.
Content: Language models will likely drive down the cost and increase the scale of propaganda
generation. As language models continue to improve, they will be able to produce persuasive
text—text that is difﬁcult to distinguish from human-generated content—with greater reliability,
reducing the need for skilled writers with deep cultural and linguistic knowledge of the target
population.
Although we foresee these changes in the medium term, there is some speculation at play. The extent to
which language models change the nature of inﬂuence operations is dependent on critical unknowns,
63including diffusion and accessibility, and various technical and social uncertainties. We do not yet know
who will control these models, and how information environments—like social media platforms—will
adapt in a world where models are widely available for use.
6.2 There Are No Silver Bullet Solutions
Section 5 discussed a large number of possible strategies for managing the threat of AI-generated inﬂu-
ence operations. Unfortunately, no proposed mitigation manages to be simultaneously (1) technically
feasible, (2) institutionally tractable, (3) robust against second-order risks, and (4) highly impactful.
The fact that large language models are increasingly proliferating—both behind paid APIs and in the
form of openly released models—currently makes it all but impossible to ensure that large language
models are never used to generate disinformation.
This is not an excuse for defeatism. Even if responding to the threat is difﬁcult, AI developers who have
built large language models have a responsibility to take reasonable steps to minimize the harms of those
models. By the same token, social media companies have a continuing obligation to take all appropriate
steps to ﬁght misinformation, while policymakers must seriously consider how they can help make a
difference. But all parties should recognize that any mitigation strategies speciﬁcally designed to target
AI-generated content will not fully address the endemic challenges.
Even if better policies can be adopted to govern the majority of language models, very few interventions
will stop a well-resourced, non-cooperative state from constructing its own alternatives. One option for
countries like the United States would be to soften immigration requirements for AI talent, which could
concentrate the ability to produce language models in a few countries—though this too will be unlikely
to fully stop a sufﬁciently motivated nation-state from developing high capability systems of their own.
6.3 Collective Responses Are Needed
Many of the mitigations discussed above might have a meaningful impact in reducing AI-generated inﬂu-
ence campaigns, but only if new forms of collaboration are developed. Strong norms among the AI com-
munity—regarding either the release of models or the training methods used to develop them—could
make it harder for the most common language models to be induced to generate disinformation. We
have also suggested that if detection of AI-generated text will be feasible at all, it will likely require
relatively large “batches” of outputted text in order to attribute. Collaboration between social media
companies and AI companies may be necessary in order to curate and attribute large batches of poten-
tially inauthentic content.
The current US response to inﬂuence operations is fractured: fractured among technology companies,
fractured among academic researchers, fractured between multiple government agencies, and fractured
on the level of collaboration between these groups. Social media companies have different approaches
to whether (and how) to treat inﬂuence operations; academics lack relevant data to understand related
issues; AI developers often lack sufﬁcient expertise to understand potential abuses of the technologies
they create, and responsibilities for inﬂuence operations are not clearly delineated to any single US
department or agency. Policymakers should consider creating stronger mechanisms and incentives to
64ensure coordination across all relevant stakeholders.212
6.4 Mitigations Must Address Demand As Well As Supply
All else being equal, the fact that a particular post was authored by an AI does not in itself make the
content of that post less truthful or more destabilizing than the same content would be coming from a
human. While this paper has focused on mitigations that would disrupt the pipeline between large lan-
guage models and inﬂuence operations, it is important to emphasize that many other mitigations can be
implemented or further strengthened that aim to reduce the spread of false or biased information gen-
erally. Some social media platforms have already implemented a number of these mitigations—though
often not equitably between English-speaking countries and other regions. But inﬂuence operations
appear to be a new normal of online activity, and more effort to improve these mitigations is warranted.
It is equally important, however, to emphasize that mitigations that disrupt the supply of misleading
information are ultimately only partial solutions if the demand for misleading information remains un-
changed. While people rarely demand to be misinformed directly, information consumers often demand
information that is cheap and useful for their goals—something inﬂuence operations can tailor to with
greater freedom from the constraints of reality.
From a selﬁsh perspective, ignorance is often rational: it is not possible to be informed on everything,
gathering accurate information can be boring, and countering false beliefs may have social costs.213
Similarly, consuming and sharing disinformation may be entertaining, attract attention, or help an indi-
vidual gain status within a polarized social group. When the personal costs of effortful analysis exceed
the personal beneﬁts, the likely result will be lower-quality contribution to group decision-making (e.g.,
sharing disinformation, free riding, groupthink, etc.).
6.5 Further Research Is Necessary
Many of the properties of large generative models are not fully understood. Similarly, clarity is still
missing regarding both the structure and the impacts of many inﬂuence operations, which are conducted
in secret.
Clarity on the scale of the threat posed by inﬂuence operations continues to be elusive. Is the actual
impact of such campaigns proportionate to the attention they receive in the popular imagination and
press coverage? How effective are existing platform-based mitigations—such as friction measures de-
signed to slow down the virality of content—at reducing the spread of misinformation? As it relates
212. The National Security Commission on AI, the Aspen Institute, and a variety of others have recommendations for how to
integrate government efforts to counter foreign-sourced inﬂuence campaigns. See Schmidt et al., Final Report ;The Weaponiza-
tion of Information: The Need for Cognitive Security (RAND Corporation, April 27, 2017); Fletcher Schoen and Christopher J.

65to inﬂuence operations with generative models speciﬁcally, future research should unpack the differen-
tial impact these technologies may have on different populations. For example, relevant factors include
the languages various models output most persuasively, and the media and internet ﬂuency in different
communities. AI developers and researchers could reach out to communities likely to be impacted to
better understand their risks and needs.
A number of technical issues are also currently ambiguous. The relationship between model size, length
of ﬁne-tuning, and overall performance or persuasiveness, for instance, is unclear. While it is generally
true that larger, more heavily trained models perform better across a wide variety of tasks—including
disinformation-related ones—it is not clear whether ﬁne-tuning a smaller model can reliably make up
that gap. How do these factors change between models primarily trained on large, well-represented
languages like English and those with more capability to use less well-represented languages? On the
mitigation side, the feasibility of detection methods remains ambiguous. Although it seems reasonable
to assume that (1) attributing short pieces of content as AI-generated will remain impossible and (2)
detection might become possible at much larger scales, it is hard to be more speciﬁc than this. What
scales are necessary to enable detection? How much can perturbing models or training on radioactive
data alter this necessary threshold? Furthermore, how realistic is it to train models in ways that reduce
their likelihood of outputting misleading content to begin with?
Further research would also be useful to better understand, model, and clarify the decision-making of
propagandists themselves. Detailed analyses of the relative gains that malicious actors can capture by
incorporating generative models into their operations are also lacking. It is similarly unclear whether API
restrictions on large language models meaningfully discourage operators from accessing certain services,
and if they do, whether operators are able to simply gravitate toward open-source models without any
loss of capability.214
Finally, this is a rapidly moving ﬁeld where norms have not yet solidiﬁed. Should AI developers release
or restrict their models? Should internet researchers publish observed tactics of propagandists or keep
them secret? To what extent can platforms and AI developers form meaningful partnerships that can aid
in the detection and removal of inauthentic content? At the broadest level, thoughtful engagement with
all of these questions—both from people within the relevant industries and from neutral, third-party
observers—is a critical necessity.
214. Forthcoming work from some of the authors will attempt to partially address this. See Musser, “A Cost Analysis of
Generative Language Models and Inﬂuence Operations”
