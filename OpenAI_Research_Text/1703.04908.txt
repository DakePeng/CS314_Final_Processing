Emergence of Grounded Compositional Language in Multi-Agent Populations Igor Mordatch OpenAI San Francisco, California, USAPieter Abbeel UC Berkeley Berkeley, California, USA Abstract By capturing statistical patterns in large corpora, machine learning has enabled signiﬁcant advances in natural language processing, including in machine translation, question answering, and sentiment analysis. However, for agents to intelligently interact with humans, simply capturing the statistical patterns is insufﬁcient. In this paper we investigate if, and how, grounded compositional language can emerge as a means to achieve goals in multi-agent populations. Towards this end, we propose a multi-agent learning environment and learning methods that bring about emergence of a basic compositional language. This language is represented as streams of abstract discrete symbols uttered by agents over time, but nonetheless has a coherent structure that possesses a deﬁned vocabulary and syntax. We also observe emergence of nonverbal communication such as pointing and guiding when language communication is unavailable. Introduction Development of agents that are capable of communication and ﬂexible language use is one of the long-standing challenges facing the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence. Agents need to develop communication if they are to successfully coordinate as a collective. Furthermore, agents will need some language capacity if they are to interact and productively collaborate with humans or make decisions that are interpretable by humans. If such a capacity were to arise artiﬁcially, it could also offer important insights into questions surrounding development of human language and cognition. But if we wish to arrive at formation of communication from ﬁrst principles, it must form out of necessity. The approaches that learn to plausibly imitate language from examples of human language, while tremendously useful, do not learn why language exists. Such supervised approaches can capture structural and statistical relationships in language, but they do not capture its functional aspects, or that language happens for purposes of successful coordination between humans. Evaluating success of such imitationbased approaches on the basis of linguistic plausibility also presents challenges of ambiguity and requirement of human involvement.

We adopt a view of (Gauthier and Mordatch 2016) that an agent possesses an understanding of language when it can use language (along with other tools such as non-verbal communication or physical acts) to accomplish goals in its environment. This leads to evaluation criteria that can be measured precisely and without human involvement. In this paper, we propose a physically-situated multiagent learning environment and learning methods that bring about emergence of a basic compositional language. This language is represented as streams of abstract discrete symbols uttered by agents over time, but nonetheless has a coherent structure that possesses a deﬁned vocabulary and syntax. The agents utter communication symbols alongside performing actions in the physical environment to cooperatively accomplish goals deﬁned by a joint reward function shared between all agents. There are no pre-designed meanings associated with the uttered symbols the agents form concepts relevant to the task and environment and assign arbitrary symbols to communicate them. There are similarly no explicit language usage goals, such as making correct utterances, and no explicit roles agents are assigned, such as speaker or listener, or explicit turntaking dialogue structure as in traditional language games. There may be an arbitrary number of agents in a population communicating at the same time and part of the difﬁculty is learning to refer speciﬁc agents. A population of agents is situated as moving particles in a continuous two-dimensional environment, possessing properties such as color and shape. The goals of the population are based on non-linguistic objectives, such as moving to a location and language arises from the need to coordinate on those goals. We do not rely on any supervision such as human demonstrations or text corpora. Similar to recent work,we formulate the discovery the action and communication protocols for our agents jointly as a reinforcement learning problem. Agents perform physical actions and communication utterances according to an identical policy that is instantiated for all agents and fully determines the action and communication protocols. The policies are based on neural network models with an architecture composed of dynamically-instantiated recurrent modules. This allows decentralized execution with a variablearXiv:1703.04908v2  [cs.AI]  24 Jul 2018number of agents and communication streams. The joint dynamics of all agents and environment, including discrete communication streams are fully-differentiable, the agents’ policy is trained end-to-end with backpropagation through time. The languages formed exhibit interpretable compositional structure that in general assigns symbols to separately refer to environment landmarks, action verbs, and agents. However, environment variation leads to a number of specialized languages, omitting words that are clear from context. For example, when there is only one type of action to take or one landmark to go to, words for those concepts do not form in the language. Considerations of the physical environment also have an impact on language structure. For example, a symbol denoting goaction is typically uttered ﬁrst because the listener can start moving before even hearing the destination. This effect only arises when linguistic and physical behaviors are treated jointly and not in isolation. The presence of a physical environment also allows for alternative strategies aside from language use to accomplish goals. A visual sensory modality provides an alternative medium for communication and we observe emergence of non-verbal communication such as pointing and guiding when language communication is unavailable. When even non-verbal communication is unavailable, strategies such as direct pushing may be employed to succeed at the task. It is important to us to build an environment with a diverse set of capabilities which language use develops alongside with. By compositionality we mean the combination of multiple words to create meaning, as opposed to holistic languages that have a unique word for every possible meaning (Kirby 2001). Our work offers insights into why such compositional structure emerges. In part, we ﬁnd it to emerge when we explicitly encourage active vocabulary sizes to be small through a soft penalty. This is consistent with analysis in evolutionary linguistics (Nowak, Plotkin, and Jansen 2000) that ﬁnds composition to emerge only when number of concepts to be expressed becomes greater than a factor of agent’s symbol vocabulary capacity. Another important component leading to composition is training on a variety of tasks and environment conﬁgurations simultaneously. Training on cases where most information is clear from context (such as when there is only one landmark) leads to formation of atomic concepts that are reused compositionally in more complicated cases. Related Work Recent years have seen substantial progress in practical natural language applications such as machine translation (Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le 2014; Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2014), sentiment analysis (Socher et al. 2013), document summarization (Durrett, Berg-Kirkpatrick, and Klein 2016), and domain-speciﬁc dialogue (Dhingra et al. 2016). Much of this success is a result of intelligently designed statistical models trained on large static datasets. However, such approaches do not produce an understanding of language that can lead to productive cooperation with humans. An interest in pragmatic view of language understanding has been longstanding (Austin 1962; Grice 1975) andhas recently argued for in (Gauthier and Mordatch 2016; Lake et al. 2016; Lazaridou, Pham, and Baroni 2016). Pragmatic language use has been proposed in the context of twoplayer reference games (Golland, Liang, and Klein 2010; V ogel et al. 2014; Andreas and Klein 2016) focusing on
