Executive Summary
OpenAIisdevelopingaresearchprogramtoassesstheeconomicimpacts
of code generation models and is inviting collaboration with external
researchers. Rapid advances in the capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) trained on code have made it increasingly important to study their
economic impacts on individuals, firms, and society. Codex – an LLM
developed by OpenAI by fine-tuning GPT-3 on billions of lines of publicly
available code from GitHub – has been shown to generate functionally
correct code 28.8% of the time on a sample of evaluation problems (Chen
et al. 2021). This may have important implications for the future of
coding and the economics of the industries that depend on it. In this
document, we lay out a research agenda to assess the effects of Codex
on economic factors of interest to policymakers, firms, and the public.
We make a case for this research agenda by highlighting the potentially
broad applicability of code generation models to software development, the
potential for other LLMs to create significant social and economic impact
as model capabilities advance, and the value of using Codex to generate
evidence and establish methodologies that may be applicable to research
on the economic impacts of future models. We propose that academic
and policy research focus on studying code generation models and other
LLMs so that evidence on their economic impacts can be used to inform
decision-making in three key areas: Deployment policy, AI system design,
and public policy. To help guide this research, we outline six priority
outcome areas within the realm of economic impacts that we intend to use
Codex to study: Productivity, Employment, Skill Development, Inter-firm

1Competition, Consumer Prices, and Economic Inequality. For each area,
we briefly discuss previous literature on the impacts of artificial intelligence
on each of these outcomes, describe questions that we believe to be key
inputs to the three decision-making areas mentioned above, and provide
examples of research that could be conducted with Codex. To catalyze
work that builds off of this initial research agenda, we are announcing a
Call for Expressions of Interest from external researchers to collaborate
with OpenAI researchers and customers to better measure the economic
impacts of code generation models and other LLMs.
1 Introduction
OpenAI is building out a research program to assess the economic impacts of code
generation models with the goal of developing tools, methods, and partnerships
that can enable improved research on the economic impacts of powerful language
models. As code generation models and other large language models (LLMs)
improve, they have the potential to impact many aspects of society, including
work, productivity, skill development, and other economic outcomes. The depth
and scope of the effects of code-generating LLMs will depend on how widespread
their use becomes, which in turn depends on factors such as their capabilities and
limitations, ease of use, associated costs, and the regulatory and institutional
environments in which they are deployed. The capabilities of present and
future code generation models may complement and/or substitute for the tasks
completed by workers in coding-centric occupations (engineers, data analysts,
software developers, etc.) by, for example:
•Impacting the costs associated with coding tasks
•Impacting the relative productivity of capital versus labor in the production
process
•Shifting the allocation of tasks in the production process to capital vs labor
•Impacting the demand for existing skills (coding-centric and not) and
spurring demand for new skills
These potential impacts are complex. Therefore, the research community’s
ability to generate decision-relevant evidence on any of the research questions
outlined in this document will be greatly enhanced by developing a range of
productive partnerships, and we firmly believe that AI developers need to support
external researchers undertaking this work, rather than conduct this research
exclusively in-house. We hope this document serves as a starting point for
collecting input from researchers, AI developers, policymakers, workers, labor
unions, and firms interested in understanding the impacts of code generation
models – and LLMs broadly – on economic outcomes. In Section 4 and in
Table 1 below we highlight six research focus areas and key questions where
OpenAI is interested in better understanding the economic impacts of code
2generation models via Codex - an LLM developed by OpenAI that translates
natural language to code (Chen et al. 2021).1Finally, we are issuing a Call for
Expressions of Interest for external researchers to collaborate with OpenAI to
better measure the economic impacts of code generation models, with the goal
of building research methods and infrastructure that can be applied to other
LLMs in the future. Similarly, we invite others deploying or using LLMs for
code generation to support this work.
1.1 Call for Expressions of Interest
We are seeking feedback on this research agenda, as well as expressions of interest
from individuals who are interested in partnering with OpenAI to study the
economic impacts of Codex and to advise future research efforts on the economic
impacts of novel LLMs. We welcome research proposals from all social science
disciplines, including but not limited to economics, labor studies, sociology, and
political science. We are also interested in engagement with private companies
who have already integrated Codex. If you or your organization have a proposal
for a research collaboration or would be interested in helping guide how OpenAI
thinks about these issues, please see the link above for details on how to submit
an expression of interest.
2 Motivations
2.1Consider economic impacts as part of the AI Safety
framework
A key motivation for the research agenda we propose in this paper is to ensure AI
safety: even though the current capabilities of Codex do not threaten large-scale
economic disruption or harm to human systems, future capabilities of code
generation or other LLMs could. It is critical to engage in research about the
economic impacts of model capabilities today in order to be positioned to assess
the safety of developing and releasing more advanced systems in the future.
Foundational work setting the technical AI safety research agenda by Amodei,
Olah, and coauthors has focused on the problem of "accidents in machine learning
systems," while strongly supporting further work on privacy, security, fairness,
economics, and policy (Amodei et al. 2016). The authors highlight the policy
question"Howdowepredictandrespondtotheeconomicandsocialconsequences
of ML?" recognizing it as an important area, overlapping with other technical
AI safety concerns, that warrants dedicated research. While far from the only
such example, socioeconomic impacts are increasingly relevant as AI systems
see increased adoption in and interaction with society (Weidinger et al. 2021).
1This document does not present a comprehensive list of all potential areas of economic
impact that would benefit from further research. This research agenda is an initial attempt at
priority-setting given the range of critical questions on the economic impact of code generation
models, and we are eagerly seeking feedback on what those priorities should be.

evidence on economic impacts.
4Systematic explorations of what might be considered “socio-economic safety” of
models—the potential impacts of powerful AI systems on people and society as
they interact with existing economic, social, and political institutions— may
yield insights that are valuable to policymakers.
Absent policy intervention, LLMs may result in socio-economic safety risks by
causing sudden negative impacts on the demand for human labor, increasing the
frequency of labor market transitions, and exacerbating inequality, for example.
Job displacement is associated with a range of negative impacts, including
subsequent unemployment, long-term earnings losses, reduced psychological and
physical well-being, family disruption, and lower levels of children’s educational
attainment and well-being (Brand 2015, Young 2012, Schmillen 2020). Beyond
affecting individual outcomes, economic impacts have the potential to shape the
societal risk landscape in important ways. For example, at a societal level, sharp
changes in the demand for human labor have been linked to higher levels of
social unrest (Caprettini and Voth 2020). Depending on the fungibility of skills
for those who experience a reduction in labor market opportunities as a result
of AI system deployment, increasingly capable models risk exacerbating wage
inequality, which in turn can amplify societal cleavages (Acemoglu and Restrepo
2021, Van de Werfhorst and Salverda 2012). In addition, differential access
to required inputs to powerful LLMs – such as hardware, internet access, and
digital literacy – will also perpetuate economic inequities (Weidinger et al. 2021).
We must take these risks seriously and consider the potential implications for
socio-economic safety when crafting deployment strategies and complimentary
public policy proposals aimed at promoting well-being.
2.2Incorporate economic impacts as inputs to key deci-
sions
A central motivation for measuring economic impacts is to help researchers,
firms, policymakers and the public better understand the populations most likely
to benefit and those that could be negatively impacted from the adoption of AI
systems that leverage LLMs. By better understanding the ways in which code
generation models like Codex can impact economic outcomes for various actors
in society, we can help inform decision-making in the three areas listed below.
•Deployment policy : Projected economic impacts are one of many criteria
AI developers can use to inform if, when, and how a new system should
be deployed to users and potential beneficiaries. By developing a deeper
empirical understanding of the economic impacts of code generation models,
research in this area can drive improved deployment policy that considers
economic well-being as a key outcome.
•AI system design : Building our collective understanding of how a model
like Codex can have tangible impacts on outcomes like productivity, employ-
ment, and skill development can illuminate ways in which future models
can be designed for greater positive economic impact and fewer harms.
5•Public policy : Research on the outcomes described in this agenda can
identify potential economic impacts for which public policy intervention
may be a helpful tool to improve economic outcomes and mitigate inequities
that could be the product of the deployment of increasingly capable AI
systems. A core goal of this stream of research is to generate improved
data and produce novel evidence that can inform the policymaking process.
2.3Build a test case for future research on the economic
impacts of language models
The research that will be immediately shaped by this agenda will focus on the
economic impacts of Codex, but we expect this research agenda to serve as a
starting point for economic impacts research that can be applied more generally
for future AI systems. There have been rapid advances in language model
capabilities over the past several years (Brown et al. 2020, Dhariwal et al. 2020,
Rae et al. 2022, Smith et al. 2022, Radford et al. 2021, Sun et al. 2021) and
we recognize that as this progress continues, there will be a heightened need to
carefullyunderstandtheevolutionofeconomicimpactsandtranslatethisresearch
into forecasting capabilities for new models. By articulating and executing on
this research agenda via Codex, we aim to identify gaps in our approach, build
research partnerships, solicit feedback, collect data on economic outcomes, and
establish learning priorities that improve our collective ability to conduct policy-
relevant economic impacts research on increasingly powerful language models
in the future. The success of this agenda rests on the collaboration of the AI
research community, policymakers, economists, and workers and we welcome
your input.
2.4Ensure that the economic impacts of progress towards
AGI are broadly beneficial to humanity
OpenAI’s mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) – defined
in OpenAI’s charter as “highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at
most economically valuable work” – benefits all of humanity (OpenAI 2018). An
important tenet of OpenAI’s deployment philosophy and policy is understanding
and mitigating the safety risks of powerful AI models before deployment. If
successful, highlycapableautonomoussystemsarenotonlyexpectedtotransform
the nature and quality of many jobs, but also perhaps engender structural
economic changes, with impacts on inequality and employment. Previous major
technological shifts such as the industrial revolution had positive long-run effects
on many facets of economic life, yet they also caused economic hardship for
segments of society that were affected by negative labor market shocks (Frey
2019). Therefore, it is critical that we generate evidence on the nature and
distribution of impacts of new AI systems to ensure that their development and
deployment can promote broad benefit to humanity in the short, medium, and
long term.
63 What is Codex?
The economic impacts we will focus on in this research agenda are relevant to
code generation models broadly. However, we plan to leverage OpenAI’s Codex
model to execute on this research agenda in the near-term. Codex is an example
of an LLM - an artificial intelligence model trained to predict text to follow
a given string of input text. For example, if an LLM like OpenAI’s GPT-3
is given the prompt "I like to eat pizza because", it might generate the text
"it is delicious." Codex is a fine-tuned version of OpenAI’s GPT-3, meaning
that it inherits GPT-3’s language capacity and is given additional training on
a wide range of programming languages (Brown et al. 2020, Chen et al. 2021).
Its capabilities in natural language give it a remarkable ability to generalize to
a wide range of tasks associated with coding, including code generation, code
completion, code repair, code translation and code question answering. These
capabilities have made it useful for a range of practical tasks, including generating
code from natural language descriptions, writing documentation or unit tests
for code snippets, completing partially written code, writing explanations for
code snippets and fixing bugs in code. The model also has important limitations,
namely that it often produces insecure code, can produce code that is not aligned
with what the user intended, and is susceptible to reproducing or amplifying
biases in the training data (Chen et al. 2021).

One may want to implement a function in code that finds the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. To write such
a function, one might start with a prompt: some text that Codex uses as input for its generation. aand babove
are prompts that we passed to Codex, containing the function name and expected arguments. Codex took a turn
and completed ainto the snippet in cand completed binto the snippet in d.
Codex can be accessed via an API, which users can access directly or via
other products built using the API. A prominent example of a Codex-based
application is Github Copilot – a tool developed by GitHub and OpenAI to
autocomplete code and generate code based on natural language comments. In
addition to Codex’s built-in capabilities, Copilot is ever-present in compatible
programming environments, suggesting code completions throughout a session,
and it has the ability to propose up to 10 suggested code completions if requested.
As Codex’s capabilities evolve, and as more developers build on top of the
API, it is likely that the available applications will also evolve. While these
7applications will be designed and released by external parties, OpenAI will likely
exertsomecontroloverthecapabilitiesoftheunderlyingCodexmodel. Therefore,
the economic impacts of Codex depend on the model’s inherent capabilities, and
how widely used its downstream applications become. Understanding the core
aspects of Codex adoption is essential to identifying the mechanisms through
which Codex could have observable economic impacts, particularly as OpenAI
controls the levers of who is given access and for what use cases. Furthermore,
studying the mechanisms of potential economic impacts is critical to ensuring
that research at OpenAI and in the broader community prioritizes the most
pressing questions, identifies blindspots where potential economic harms might
exist, and makes evidence-based assumptions about how economic impacts may
change as model capabilities evolve.
4 Research Agenda: Focus Areas
This section outlines several preliminary focus areas for our research agenda on
the economic impacts of code generation models. We divide these focus areas
into two categories:
1.Direct impacts, which will include productivity, employment, and skill
development, and
2.Indirect impacts which will include inter-firm competition, consumer prices,
and economic inequality.
The distinction between direct and indirect impacts is not meant to understate
the importance of the indirect impacts as drivers of economic well-being. The
categorization is useful to highlight the fact that research on direct impacts will
often be a necessary input for precise research on indirect impacts. For example,
to assess the impacts of code generation models on economic inequality, it is
critical to better understand the distribution of impacts on employment and
wages. Similarly, in order to enhance our understanding of how these models
impact consumer prices, it is helpful to measure whether or not they introduce
any changes in productivity within the production process for goods and services.
While this section identifies potential economic impacts of code generation
models beyond just Codex, we plan to use Codex to generate evidence on the
magnitude and direction of impacts. As such, we speak below about the potential
impacts that Codex specifically may have on individuals, firms, and society.
The impacts of LLMs such as Codex on economic outcomes will vary widely
depending on a number of underlying factors (Frank et al. 2019, Klinova and
Korinek2021, TrammellandKorinek2021, Weidingeretal.2021). Understanding
the differential impact of code generation models – whether mediated by use-case,
geography, labor market, firm, or individual characteristics – will be a priority
for research across all of the focus areas described below.
84.1 Direct Impacts
4.1.1 Productivity
Background Neoclassical economic theory predicts that at the aggregate
level, technological progress increases overall productivity (Romer 1990, Solow
1956). However, recent decades have not seen as strong productivity growth
as might have been expected given rapid advancement in technology (Gordon
2018, Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson 2017). In order to project the oncoming
productivity impacts of AI, Brynjolfsson, Benzell, and Rock warn against relying
on previous trends and instead suggest a need to “... study and understand
the specific technologies that actually exist and make an assessment of their
potential.” (Brynjolfsson, Benzell, and Rock 2020) The roll-out of Codex presents
an opportunity to study the micro-level impact of code-generating AI on indi-
vidual level productivity, a subject that will be key to understanding the current
relationship between technological progress and economic growth.
Damioli and coauthors take a step in this direction by examining data from
5,257 firms worldwide that filed one or more patents related to AI between
2000 and 2016 (Damioli, Van Roy, and Vertesy 2021). The authors find that
AI patent applications have a positive effect on within-firm labor productivity.
This study is among the first to estimate a causal relationship between new AI
technologies and the productivity of the firms that develop those technologies.
Indeed, literature on the causal impact of AI on individual firms is scarce, largely
due to a lack of firm-level data. Multiple recent papers make an explicit call
for more firm-level data in order to build a clearer understanding of the impact
of AI on a range of economic outcomes, and how those impacts are mediated
by firm characteristics (Seamans and Raj 2018, Frank et al. 2019). Through
OpenAI’s partnerships with firms that have adopted Codex, we intend to build
on previous research that has used novel data collection approaches to measure
the impact of code generation tools on productivity (Xu, Vasilescu, and Neubig
2021) and respond directly to this call for further firm-level data by examining
the impact of Codex on both worker and firm-level measures of productivity.
How Codex May Impact Productivity Codex has the potential to increase
the productivity of individual workers in coding-centric roles. The adoption of
Codex could reduce the amount of time needed to look up syntax, reference
old code, add documentation, write basic programs or switch between tasks
and projects. Individuals who use Codex models or applications could also
realize productivity effects via faster code, higher code quality, or improved
documentation. Through the applications built with Codex, productivity could
be enhanced not solely for coding tasks but for many tasks related to design,
engineering, and data visualization. We are interested in understanding the
distribution of productivity impacts on workers across the spectrum of tasks,
skills and roles. This includes workers in coding-centric roles as well as workers in
non-coding positions who may be affected by increased automation or adoption
of productivity-enhancing tools built using Codex.
9Broad Research Questions
•What is the impact of Codex adoption on firm, team, and worker produc-
tivity?
•What are the firm, worker, and use-case characteristics that drive differen-
tial impacts on productivity?
•What are the mechanisms through which productivity impacts firms, teams,
and individual workers?
4.1.2 Employment
Background A growing literature in economics has renewed the recent focus of
researchers on the potential impacts of technological advancement on employment
(AcemogluandRestrepo2018, Autor2015, BrynjolfssonandMcAfee2014, Mokyr,
Vickers, and Ziebarth 2015, Tolan et al. 2021). Frey and Osborne estimate that
47% of total US employment is susceptible to automation (Frey and Osborne
2017). Aghion and coauthors highlight that the aggregate effects of AI on
employment will be heavily mediated by competition, labor, and education
policy (Aghion, Antonin, and Bunel 2020). Expert forecasts vary in their
predictions, but overall suggest a considerable chance that AI will surpass human
capabilities at most tasks within several decades.2
How Codex May Impact Employment The adoption of Codex and other
code-generating AI could have a potentially large impact on employment in the
technology and information sectors. As Codex’s capabilities continue to expand,
Codex may eventually serve as a substitute for a larger share of coding tasks
currently completed by human labor. Alternatively, Codex may augment human
labor such that it is adopted as a net complement to labor and increases the
demand for workers who perform tasks such as detailed code review, intensive
quality assurance, or the application of sales and logistics expertise. Additionally,
Codex could spark a need for new skills, changing team composition and shifting
demand towards new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage, a
phenomenon researchers have called the “reinstatement effect” (Acemoglu and
Restrepo 2019). The effects of code generation models on the completion of
micro-work tasks outsourced by firms to gig-economy workers is another potential
avenue of impact on worker opportunity and well-being.
With respect to Codex, we are interested in empirically assessing how these
dynamics will unfold, particularly as the model progresses in its capabilities.
Understanding the balance of displacement versus reinstatement of tasks and
jobs across different industries, firms, and use-cases is an essential input to
2Expert forecasts collected by Grace and coauthors, for example, give a 50% chance
that AI systems will outperform humans at all tasks by 2063, and a 10% probability that
those capabilities will exist by 2027 (Grace et al. 2018). More recent forecasts collected by
Gruetzemacher and coauthors suggest there is a 50% chance that AI systems would be capable
of automating 90% of human tasks by 2045.(Gruetzemacher, Paradice, and Lee 2020)
10forecasting future direct labor market impacts as the capabilities of Codex and
other code-generating models evolve.
Of particular interest is whether we can leverage worker and firm-level data to
identify trends in the potential demand shifts for various types of skills and how
fungible those skills are in the labor market. If we expect Codex to drive down
demand for entry level coders (or other roles with rote and repetitive coding
tasks) but drive up demand for senior engineers and managers, for example, then
we will want to have an informed estimate of the impacts that may have on
wage and mobility outcomes to inform deployment and public policy decisions.
We hope that foundational research on the employment impacts of Codex can
enable increasingly policy-relevant research to be done to project longer-term
impacts of future code-generating AI models.
In addition to impacts on total employment, Codex may also impact job
quality and the nature of work itself. Broadly, advances in AI have the potential
to reduce occupational safety risks for certain jobs, create new opportunities
for aging workers or those with disabilities, and substitute for overly repetitive
and mundane tasks (EU-OSHA 2021). However, increased automation can drive
social isolation at work, increased specialization, performance pressure, reduced
worker autonomy and overbearing worker surveillance, all of which may reduce
well-being on the job (Kaplan and Schulhofer-Wohl 2018, Partnership on AI
2020, Weidinger et al. 2021). Measuring the effects of Codex on job quality is a
key input to understanding the broader impacts of Codex on worker well-being.
Potential Research Questions
•What is the impact of Codex adoption on the demand for human coding
labor?
•What is the impact of Codex adoption on the demand for human labor in
non-coding roles?
•What human coding tasks are most likely to be substituted by Codex and
how is that labor reallocated?
•What new tasks does Codex introduce into the production process and
what skills are demanded to complete them?
•What is the impact of Codex adoption on job quality?
4.1.3 Skill development
Background A large body of literature suggests that complementarities be-
tween technological advances and high-skilled labor can drive increasing returns
to skill development (Acemoglu and Autor 2011, Bound and Johnson 1992,
Goos 2018, Katz and Murphy 1992). Predictable pathways towards a labor
reinstatement effect from Codex include increased demand for skills such as
prompt engineering, Codex-specific debugging, and specialized quality assurance
of AI-generated outputs. Given the likelihood that Codex could generate demand
11for new skills in the labor force, we would like to examine the ways that Codex
can also drive the development of new skills when incorporated into training and
education programs. By examining this question empirically with Codex, we
intend to contribute to a body of literature that has investigated the impact of
technological development on skill development. Several descriptive case studies
summarize the experiences of students or firms that integrate low-code software
tools into work and learning environments (Beranic, Rek, and Hericko 2020,
Corral, Fronza, and Pahl 2021). However, we are not aware of any empirical
work estimating the impact of these tools on skill development or retention.
How Codex May Impact Skill Development The ability for Codex to
make coding suggestions could either enhance a user’s learning process or create
inattentiverelianceonCodexthatmaystiflecreativityanditerativelearning. Itis
plausible that Codex suggestions disincentivize coders from learning or retaining
new knowledge when they feel they can rely on Codex. We are particularly
interested in learning whether or not this is the case at the frontier of human
coding innovation and skill development. Estimating the impact of Codex on
coding skill development can help us understand the impact on human coding
innovation – an important driver of technological progress and an essential data
input for increasingly powerful code generation tools. Furthermore, evaluating
the impacts of Codex on skill development for coders and non-coders alike can
influence decisions about future education policy and the design of training
programs that match the needs of the economy.
Potential Research Questions
•How does the introduction of Codex to coding education programs change
the skills that learners develop?
•How does the adoption of Codex for use by advanced coders impact their
coding innovation, creativity, and skill development?
•What non-coding skill development trends are impacted most by the
applications built using the Codex API?
•What implications might the use of Codex in education and training have
for amplification of certain coding practices?
4.2 Indirect Impacts
The outcomes included in this section are listed separately from those above
purely because we expect the outputs from research on the “direct” impacts
above to be key inputs into understanding the impact of Codex on these “indirect”
impacts. The distinction between direct and indirect impacts does not reflect a
difference in the relative importance of the outcomes in either group within this
research agenda.
124.2.1 Consumer Prices
Background Technological progress has made the production of countless
goods and services cheaper over time (Roser 2016). Researchers have speculated
that as the general capabilities of AI advance, the costs of labor to produce many
goods and services could fall dramatically, driving a reduction in the market price
for consumer goods and services (Stone et al. 2016). Such an impact would rely
on AI systems introducing productivity and efficiency gains into the production
process, including by substituting human labor with automated systems that
run at lower marginal costs.
How Codex May Affect Consumer Prices Codex provides a tangible
opportunity to better understand how the introduction of a specific, potentially
powerful AI system can impact the costs of production, and how that impact
is passed on to consumers via prices. By augmenting any production process
that in part relies on code generation, Codex could have a downstream impact
on the prices of goods and services. Through partnerships with firms that have
adopted Codex, we can learn about the impact of Codex on factors of production,
and begin to build an understanding of how those impacts are passed on to
consumers, if at all. Given the growing importance of coding and software as
an input to the production of goods and services, understanding this impact for
one code generation model could foster better understanding of the potential
impacts of increasingly capable code generation models in the future.
Potential Research Questions
•What is the impact of Codex adoption on the price of goods and services
produced by the adopting entity?
•What mechanisms drive observed impacts on prices, and how might these
impacts scale with model improvements?
4.2.2 Inter-firm competition
Background AI-adopting firms with a better ability to collect and use data
– specifically data that is inaccessible to their competitors – may drive “unfair
competition” (Acemoglu 2021a). As a result, particularly well-positioned firms
could capture excessive consumer surplus and relax price competition in the
market (Acemoglu 2021a). Investments in AI technology have been shown to be
correlated with increased firm growth, particularly among already large firms
relative to others in their industry (Babina et al. 2021). Better understanding
the potential for Codex to drive increased industry concentration is a critical
input to improved deployment strategy and public policy design.
How Codex May Impact Inter-firm Competition The effective adoption
of Codex could spark productivity and efficiency gains, potentially driving faster
growth at the firm level. We’re interested in understanding the characteristics of
13a firm that make it more likely to realize the economic impacts from Codex. Are
there existing monopolies within industries that Codex would further entrench?
What impact would the adoption of Codex have on competition and what role
should those impacts play in deployment policy?
A deeper understanding of the impacts of modern AI-system adoption on
competition is urgently needed. However, without a sample of several hundred
firms, many confounding factors would limit our ability to causally identify the
impact of Codex on firm-level competition dynamics. As such, our priority in the
short term is to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms through which
Codex might accelerate firm-level growth, focusing empirical research on the
“direct” impacts described previously in this document that might effect market
dynamics. We encourage expressions of interest from scholars interested in
guiding our approach to better understanding impacts on competition dynamics
and how Codex might impact the underlying drivers of shifts in market power.
Potential Research Questions
•What is the impact of Codex adoption on firm growth? How is this impact
mediated by firm and industry characteristics?
•Under what circumstances might Codex adoption increase the risk of
harmful monopolies?
4.2.3 Economic Inequality
Background In the US, the average 2021 annual income among individuals in
the top 1% of earners ($1.6m) was approximately 84x higher than the average
income of individuals in the bottom 50% of earners ($19.1k) (Blanchet, Saez, and
Zuckman 2022). The divergence of both income and wealth in the US since the
1980s has been attributed in part to the economic impacts of technological change
(Jaumotte, Lall, and Papageorgiou 2013, Acemoglu 2002, Rotman 2014). Nu-
merous studies have demonstrated that middle-wage jobs have been increasingly
displaced through technological innovation in recent decades. Highly routine
jobs have been particularly susceptible to displacement, while those requiring
abstract or manual tasks (professional, managerial, and technical occupations at
the higher end of the wage spectrum as well as service and labor jobs at the other)
have proven less susceptible (Autor 2015, Autor, Levy, and Murnane 2003, Autor
and Dorn 2013, Goos and Manning 2007). This phenomenon has been termed
“job polarization” and has been attributed to skill-biased and routine-biased
technological change (Berman, Bound, and Machin 1998, Goos and Manning
2007, Goos, Manning, and Salomons 2014). A core driver of the distributive
economic impacts of LLMs and other AI systems is whether they are primarily
used to augment and complement human labor or replace it (Brynjolfsson 2022,
Acemoglu and Restrepo 2021).
How Codex May Affect Economic Inequality Codex presents an example
of how the scope of “routine” automatable tasks can change over time (Lu 2015).
14This shift may be gradual and uneven, particularly across different labor markets,
with some workers and firms adopting new technologies more readily than others.
This may lead to a widening of existing disparities in skill, training, or digital
literacy, or to greater inequality in the distribution of economic benefits from
technology.
The adoption of new technologies and automation methods is not inevitable.
Different firms and workers may have different preferences and costs for adopt-
ing new technology. In addition, some workers may be unable to adopt new
technologies due to the high cost of complementary technologies, the high cost
of retraining, or insufficient digital literacy. The adoption of Codex therefore
may correlate with – and exacerbate – existing inequities in technology access,
digital literacy, and economic opportunity. There is a risk that the economic
benefits of code generation models may be shared unequally, with much of the
gains flowing to the owners of capital, such as investors and shareholders.
By partnering with external academics and Codex customers, we aim to
foster research that helps assess the impact of Codex on the distribution of
income, skills, wealth, and economic mobility. The outcomes of this research will
be key inputs to policy design aimed at mitigating any distributional impacts of
new AI systems that may amplify harmful inequities.
Potential Research Questions
•How does Codex adoption correlate with other indicators of economic
opportunityand mobilityat thefirm level (industrytype, firmsize, location,
etc.) and individual level (income, wealth, race, zip code, etc.)?
•How can alternate model deployment strategies reduce the risk of harmfully
exacerbating economic inequalities?
•How does Codex adoption change labor demand across the income and
skill distribution?
5 Prioritization
We listed numerous avenues for research above and we encourage collaborations
to pursue them all. When considering which projects to initiate, we will prioritize
research that has the following characteristics:
•Helps build sustained partnerships for data sharing and research collabora-
tion that can improve learning about the economic impacts of LLMs over
time.
•Has the potential to inform deployment decisions for code generation
models or could directly influence public policy decisions meant to enhance
the economic benefits of these models and minimize any negative impacts.
15•Helps segment aspects of code generation models based on their likely
economic impact, both positive and negative, in order to inform future
model design decisions.
•Helps OpenAI, other AI developers and external research partners estimate
the potential future economic impacts of improved code generation models.
•Is unlikely to happen without OpenAI support.
•Is most likely to succeed if led by researchers who are external to OpenAI.
6 Conclusion
This research agenda is just one of several recent contributions meant to inform
the direction of future work to ensure that the economic impacts of AI are as
universally positive as possible (Acemoglu 2021a, Acemoglu 2021b, Partnership
on AI 2021, Siddarth et al. 2021, Weidinger et al. 2021, Autor, Mindell, and
Reynolds 2022). We are excited by progress in the fields of AI ethics, safety, and
alignment research and recognize that as the capabilities of AI systems advance,
so too will the potential impacts of key decisions related to AI system design,
deployment, and public policy. It is our hope that this research agenda will
not only inspire deeper conversation about the economic impacts of increasingly
capableLLMsbutalso–pairedwiththeCallforExpressionsofInterest–catalyze
concrete action to measure economic impacts and inform decision-making in
these areas.
